<h4>Background Selection</h4>

<a href="/species/S1355/comparison">Compare with UK distribution</a>

<h4>Description and ecological characteristics</h4>
<p>
<P>The <B>otter <I>Lutra lutra</B></I> is a semi-aquatic mammal, which occurs in a wide range of ecological conditions, including inland freshwater and coastal areas (particularly in Scotland). Populations in coastal areas utilise shallow, inshore marine areas for feeding but also require fresh water for bathing and terrestrial areas for resting and breeding holts. Coastal otter habitat ranges from sheltered wooded inlets to more open, low-lying coasts. Inland populations utilise a range of running and standing freshwaters. These must have an abundant supply of food (normally associated with high water quality), together with suitable habitat, such as vegetated river banks, islands, reedbeds and woodland, which are used for foraging, breeding and resting. </P></p>

<h4>European status and distribution</h4>
<p>
<P>The <B>otter <I>Lutra lutra</B></I> was once widespread in Europe, but populations declined sharply during the 1960s and 1970s due to pollution, exacerbated by hunting and habitat loss. Currently it has a rather discontinuous distribution with strong populations in Greece, Spain, Portugal and much of eastern Europe. Over most of continental western Europe the species is scarce to extinct, but reintroduction or restocking projects are in progress in several countries. </P></p>

<h4>UK status and distribtution</h4> 
<p>Click <a href=/species/S1355/map>here</a> view UK distribution of this species</p>
<p>
<P>Historically, <B>otters <I>Lutra lutra</B></I> occurred over most of the UK. However, persecution, habitat loss and, more recently, the impact of toxic organochlorine insecticides caused a marked reduction in the range of the species. At present, the majority of the otter population in Great Britain occurs in Scotland, with a significant proportion of this number being found in the north and west of the country. Other strong populations survive in Wales and Ireland. The otter is still scarce over much of England, where the highest concentrations are in the south-west. However, recent surveys suggest that the otter population is recovering well and recolonising parts of its former range.</P></p>

Not only are the Shetland animals morphologically distinct from their mainland counterparts, they are also believed to be genetically distinct. In addition, specialists consider that the populations are possibly the densest in Europe. Therefore, the Shetland population is in many ways unique, and is considered of special importance in a UK context. Within Shetland, the Yell Sound area has the highest density of otter. Indeed the site is believed to support more than 2% of the entire GB otter population. The site consists of a complex of islands and coastline, selected to include the areas of highest otter density. The areas are characterised by low-lying peaty coastlines with large numbers of otter holts and easy access to fresh water. The adjacent marine areas have extensive algal beds which are used for foraging.</div></div>
