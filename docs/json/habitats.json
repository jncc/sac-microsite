Lagoons show a wide range of geographical and ecological variation; five main sub-types have been identified in the UK, on the basis of their physiography, as meeting the definition of the Annex&nbsp;I habitat type.</P>\r\n<OL>\r\n<LI><STRONG>Isolated lagoons</STRONG>. These are separated completely from the sea or estuary by a barrier of rock or sediment. Seawater enters by limited groundwater seepage or by over-topping of the sea barrier. Salinity is variable but often low. Isolated lagoons are often transient features with a limited life-span due to natural processes of infilling and coastal erosion. </LI>\r\n<LI><STRONG>Percolation lagoons</STRONG>. These are normally separated from the sea by shingle banks. Seawater enters by percolating through the shingle or occasionally by over-topping the bank (e.g. in storms). The water level shows some variation with tidal changes, and salinity may vary. Since percolation lagoons are normally formed by natural processes of sediment transport, they are relatively transient features, which may be eroded and swept away over a period of years or decades or may become infilled by movement of the shingle bank.</LI>\r\n<LI><STRONG>Silled lagoons</STRONG>. Water in silled lagoons is retained at all states of the tide by a barrier of rock (the ‘sill’). There is usually little tidal rise-and-fall. Seawater input is regular (i.e. on most tides) and although salinity may be seasonally variable, it is usually high, except where the level of the sill is near to high tide level. These lagoons are restricted to the north and west of Scotland and may occur as sedimentary basins or in bedrock (where they are called ‘oban’). Muddy areas are dominated by filamentous green algae, amongst which may be colonies of rare charophytes, such as foxtail stonewort<I> Lamprothamnium papulosum</I>. There may be beds of tasselweed <I>Ruppia </I>spp. and, in the deeper most stable lagoons, eelgrass <I>Zostera marina</I>. </LI>\r\n<LI><STRONG>Sluiced lagoons</STRONG>. Sluiced lagoons are formed where the natural movement of water between the lagoon and the sea is modified by artificial structures, such as a culvert under a road or valved sluices. Communities present in sluiced lagoons vary according to the type of substrate and salinity, but may resemble those of silled lagoons.</LI>\r\n<LI><STRONG>Lagoonal inlets</STRONG>. Seawater enters lagoonal inlets on each tide and salinity is usually high, particularly at the seaward part of the inlet. Larger examples of this sub-type may have a number of different basins, separated by sills, and demonstrate a complete gradient from full salinity through brackish to freshwater. This salinity gradient significantly increases the habitat and species diversity of the sites in which it occurs.</LI></OL>\r\n<P>The water in lagoons can vary in salinity from brackish (owing to dilution of seawater by freshwater) to hypersaline (i.e. more salty than seawater as a result of evaporation). The plant and animal communities of lagoons vary according to the physical characteristics and salinity regime of the lagoon, and consequently there are significant differences between sites. Although, compared to other marine habitats, there is usually only a limited range of species present, they are especially adapted to the varying salinity regimes of lagoons and some are unique to lagoon habitats. The vegetation may include beds of eelgrass <I>Zostera </I>spp.,<I> </I>tasselweed <I>Ruppia</I> spp., and pondweeds<I> Potamogeton</I> spp.,<I> </I>or stoneworts such as foxtail stonewort<I> Lamprothamnium papulosum</I>. In more rocky lagoons, communities of fucoid wracks <I>Fucus </I>spp., sugar kelp <I>Laminaria saccharina</I>, and red and green algae are also found. The fauna is often characterised by mysid shrimps and other small crustaceans, worms that burrow into the sediment, gastropod molluscs, and some fish species.

Intertidal areas are only included within this Annex&nbsp;I type where they are connected to subtidal reefs. <B>Reefs</B> are very variable in form and in the communities that they support. Two main types of reef can be recognised: those where animal and plant communities develop on rock or stable boulders and cobbles, and those where structure is created by the animals themselves (biogenic reefs). </P>\r\n<P>Rocky reefs are extremely variable, both in structure and in the communities they support. A wide range of topographical reef forms meet the EU definition of this habitat type. These range from vertical rock walls to horizontal ledges, sloping or flat bed rock, broken rock, boulder fields, and aggregations of cobbles. Reefs are characterised by communities of attached algae (where there is sufficient light – on the shore and in the shallow subtidal) and invertebrates, usually associated with a range of mobile animals, including invertebrates and fish. The specific communities that occur vary according to a number of factors. For example, rock type is important, with particularly distinct communities associated with chalk and limestone. There may be further variety associated with topographical features such as vertical rock walls, gully and canyon systems, outcrops from sediment, and rockpools on the shore.</P>\r\n<P>The greatest variety of communities is typically found where coastal topography is highly varied, with a wide range of exposures to wave action and tidal streams. Exposure to wave action has a major effect on community structure, with extremely exposed habitats dominated by a robust turf of sponges, anemones and foliose red seaweed, while reefs in the most sheltered sea lochs and rias support delicate or silt-tolerant filamentous algae, fan-worms, ascidians and brachiopods. The presence of enhanced tidal streams often significantly increases species diversity, although some communities require very still conditions. The strength of tidal streams varies considerably, from negligible in many sea loch basins, to very strong at 8-10&nbsp;knots (4-5&nbsp;<FONT size=2>m&nbsp;s<SUP>-1</SUP></FONT>) or more through tidal rapids or in sounds. In strong tidal streams there are communities of barnacles, the soft coral <I>Alcyonium digitatum</I>, massive sponges and hydroids.</P>\r\n<P>In addition, in the UK there is a marked biogeographical trend in species composition related to temperature, with warm, temperate species such as the sea-fan <I>Eunicella verrucosa</I> and the corals <I>Leptopsammia pruvoti</I> and <I>Balanophyllia regia</I>, occurring in the south, and cold-water species, such as the anemone <I>Bolocera tuediae</I> and the red seaweed <I>Ptilota plumosa</I>, in the north. A major factor affecting reef communities is the turbidity of the water. In turbid waters, light penetration is low and seaweeds can occur only in shallow depths or in the intertidal zone. However, in such conditions animals have a plentiful supply of suspended food and filter-feeding species may be abundant. Salinity is also important.

Exposure to the sea is a key determinant of the type of sea cliff vegetation. In the UK exposure is greatest on the south-west and northern coasts. The long fetch associated with these coasts generates high waves and swell, and the prevailing winds help deliver salt spray to the cliff face and cliff tops. However, the degree to which this affects the salinity of cliff-top vegetation also depends on the amount of rainfall, with high rainfall areas, such as north-west Scotland, being less saline or maritime than drier areas such as south-east England. Exposure is another important factor. The most exposed areas support maritime vegetation dominated by a range of salt-tolerant plants. More sheltered cliffs support communities closely related to those found on similar substrates inland, such as grassland and heath, with only a minor maritime element in the flora.</P>\r\n<P>The vegetation of sea cliffs in the UK includes 12 maritime cliff NVC types, although the range of vegetation types present is much broader. There is considerable geographical variation. Southern types are rich in Atlantic-Mediterranean species, while northern sites support boreal species such as the endemic Scottish primrose <I>Primula scotica</I>. Cliff-top heath vegetation is included in the Annex&nbsp;I definition, and comprises maritime heath communities referable to NVC types H7&nbsp;<I>Calluna vulgaris – Scilla verna</I> heath and H8d&nbsp;<I>Calluna vulgaris – Ulex gallii</I> heath <I>S.&nbsp;verna</I> sub-community. Cliff-top heath vegetation may extend landward into non-maritime zones, where it is considered as part of Annex&nbsp;I type <B>4030 European dry heaths</B>.</P>\r\n<P>Cliff structure and geomorphological processes are major influences on cliff vegetation. ‘Hard’ cliffs with vertical or very steep faces are characteristic of hard igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks and also of chalk, which, although a soft rock, nevertheless forms vertical cliffs. ‘Soft’ cliffs have a sloping or slumped profile, often with a distinct ‘undercliff’; they occur on a range of soft rocks, or on hard rocks interspersed with softer deposits. The more mobile soft cliffs occur where there are unstable soft deposits such as mudstones or glacial drift deposits. They may be subject to mudslides or landslips, which create complexes of pioneer and more mature vegetation.</P>\r\n<P>The profile and stability of the cliff face is one of the major determinants of cliff vegetation. Even near-vertical cliffs support specialist crevice communities, with rock samphire <I>Crithmum maritimum</I>, and in the north, Scots lovage <I>Ligusticum scoticum</I>, while ledges occupied by breeding seabirds may develop specialist nitrophilous communities comprising plant species which are able to cope with heavy guano deposition. On less extreme slopes, species tolerant of exposure to wind and salt spray and of thin soils can find a foothold. The most characteristic maritime cliff communities occur in such situations. On relatively stable soft cliffs a wide range of progressively less-specialised communities can occur, including grassland, heath, scrub and even woodland. More mobile soft cliffs show a complex sequence of successional communities related to degrees of instability and the age of the slope. The vegetation of these sites forms a mosaic of pioneer, ruderal, grassland, scrub and woodland communities. Streams and flushes provide a freshwater wetland element, and seepage lines may be rich in orchids. The vegetation of mobile soft cliffs is inadequately described by the NVC at present.</P>\r\n<P>The second major influence on maritime cliff vegetation is the nature of the underlying rock or drift deposit, notably whether it is basic or acidic. In the most exposed situations this effect is masked by the saline influence of sea spray, but more sheltered cliffs support communities closely related to those found on similar substrates inland, with only a minor maritime element in the flora. Thus, chalk and limestone cliffs support calcareous grassland communities, while acidic hard rocks support heath communities. Base-rich hard rocks, such as the limestones of the south coast or the basic igneous rocks of the Lizard, support particularly rich assemblages of rare plants and plant communities. </P>\r\n<P>The maritime influence on cliff communities is shown in both vertical and lateral zonation. The effects of salt spray are greatest close to the sea and least at the cliff top, especially where a sloping profile sets this back from the shoreline. Superimposed on this pattern is the effect of local topography. The most maritime sites are those facing the prevailing winds or the longest ‘fetch’ of open sea, notably headlands projecting from the coastline and gullies or blowholes which funnel salt water up the cliff. On the sheltered side of headlands and in bays the maritime influence is progressively diminished and is replaced by a mild, humid climate in which plant species normally restricted to woodland are found in open situations, often associated with bracken<I> Pteridium aquilinum</I>.</P></FONT>","EUStatus":"<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>Vegetated sea cliffs occur discontinuously along the west-facing coasts of Europe.

Dry heaths vary in their flora and fauna according to climate, and are also influenced by altitude, aspect, soil conditions (especially base-status and drainage), maritime influence, and grazing and burning intensity. There is a gradation from southerly to northerly kinds of dry heath, and there are also both western (oceanic) and eastern (more continental) forms.</P>\r\n<P>On slightly damp soils in the mild, oceanic climate of south-west England and south Wales, there is the uncommon H4 <I>Ulex– Agrostis</I> heath, characterised by the frequency of bristle bent <I>Agrostis curtisii </I>and western gorse <I>Ulex gallii</I>, alongside <I>Calluna</I>, bell heather <I>Erica cinerea</I> and cross-leaved heath <I>E.&nbsp;tetralix</I>.

The semi-continental H1 <I>Calluna – Festuca </I>heaths of Breckland on the western Norfolk-Suffolk border are generally overwhelmingly dominated by <I>Calluna</I>, with, sometimes, an abundance of lichens.

On more exposed and windswept ground, a range of dwarf-shrubs may dominate, forming an altitudinal progression. The first in the progression, and often the most extensive, are heaths dominated by <I>Calluna</I> growing in a prostrate form (H13 <I>Calluna – Cladonia</I> and H14 <I>Calluna – Racomitrium</I> heaths). Heather may also be combined with dwarf juniper <I>Juniperus communis </I>ssp. <I>nana </I>(H15 <I>Calluna – Juniperus</I> heath) or with <I>Arctostaphylos alpinus </I>and <I>Loiseleuria procumbens </I>(H17 <I>Calluna – Arctostaphylos alpinus </I>heath). At higher altitudes, where conditions are too extreme for heather, short or prostrate <I>Vaccinium </I>spp. and <I>E.&nbsp;nigrum </I>ssp. <I>hermaphroditum </I>dominate (H19 <I>Vaccinium – Cladonia</I> and H20<I> Vaccinium – Racomitrium</I> heaths).

For example, in the east, favoured by a less oceanic climate, lichens may be abundant (especially those of the reindeer-moss group <I>Cladonia </I>spp.). These heaths achieve the nearest approach in the UK to the lichen heaths of Scandinavia and the Arctic (especially in the <I>Calluna – Cladonia</I> and <I>Vaccinium – Cladonia</I> communities), and often support rare montane species. Conversely, in the more oceanic climate of the north-west and north, woolly fringe-moss <I>Racomitrium lanuginosum</I>, bell heather <I>Erica cinerea </I>and Atlantic liverworts and mosses (especially the species of the northern Atlantic hepatic mat) may be abundant in <I>Calluna – Racomitrium</I>, <I>Calluna – Juniperus</I>, <I>Calluna – Arctostaphylos alpinus</I> and <I>Vaccinium – Racomitrium</I> heaths. In the northern Scottish Highlands and Northern Isles, favoured by a cooler climate, mountain bearberry <I>Arctostaphylos alpinus </I>and trailing azalea <I>Loiseleuria procumbens </I>are abundant (characteristically in <I>Calluna – Arctostaphylos alpinus </I>heath, but also in <I>Calluna – Racomitrium</I> and <I>Calluna – Juniperus</I> heath).

It is predominantly a natural habitat, with succession prevented by the harsh climate at the high altitudes at which it is found. It tends to be associated with the more sheltered areas of the upper subalpine and low alpine zones of mountains, and there may be a positive association with moderately late snow-lie. Stands of <I>Salix</I> scrub survive on ungrazed ledges and, more rarely, on lightly grazed, steep rocky slopes or boulder fields, occurring only as small, discrete stands or more scattered bushes. Grazing is believed to have reduced and restricted its occurrence. At many sites its continued future is precarious, since it is confined to often unstable rock ledges and reproducing populations are very small, isolated, and of uncertain long-term viability. The largest continuous stand of this very local habitat type is about 0.5&nbsp;ha in extent and most stands are very much smaller.</P>\r\n<P>The Annex&nbsp;I habitat type consists of a mixture of willow species which have arctic-alpine and arctic-subarctic distributions in Europe.

Where juniper is not dominant the scrub contains a rich assemblage of other shrubs, mainly of the family Rosaceae. Further north, at higher altitude on limestone, juniper scrub is often associated with limestone pavements and calcareous cliffs and screes. Beyond the distribution range of many rosaceous shrubs and often in heavily grazed situations, such scrub may be relatively poor in specialist scrub species.

The habitat is the most extensive type of vegetation in the high mountain zone, i.e. above an altitude of about 750&nbsp;m. It characteristically forms large continuous tracts, covering summit plateaux and the tops of the higher summits and ridges. The habitat comprises a range of grassland types whose composition is influenced by contrasting extremes of exposure and snow-lie. Late-lie snow-bed communities dominated by bryophytes and dwarf-herbs are also included within the definition of the habitat. The flora is characterised by a strong montane element which includes several uncommon vascular plants, mosses and liverworts. It is also the most important habitat for Eurasian dotterel <I>Charadrius morinellus</I>, Britain’s only montane wading bird. The habitat is vulnerable to nutrient inputs and physical damage such as occur due to dunging and urination by grazing animals, acid deposition, human and animal trampling, skiing and use of all-terrain vehicles.</P>\r\n<P>There are seven main sub-types of <B>Siliceous alpine and boreal grasslands</B> recognised by the NVC, which are mostly referred to as ‘heath’ or snow-bed communities. These are:</P>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>U7&nbsp; <I>Nardus stricta – Carex bigelowii</I> grass-heath</LI>\r\n<LI>U8&nbsp; <I>Carex bigelowii – Polytrichum</I> alpinum sedge-heath</LI>\r\n<LI>U9&nbsp; <I>Juncus trifidus – Racomitrium lanuginosum </I>rush-heath</LI>\r\n<LI>U10&nbsp; <I>Carex bigelowii – Racomitrium lanuginosum</I> moss-heath</LI>\r\n<LI>U11&nbsp; <I>Polytrichum sexangulare – Kiaeria starkei </I>snow-bed</LI>\r\n<LI>U12&nbsp; <I>Salix herbacea – Racomitrium heterostichum </I>snow-bed </LI>\r\n<LI>U14&nbsp; <I>Alchemilla alpina – Sibbaldia procumbens </I>dwarf-herb community</LI></UL>\r\n<P>U10&nbsp;<I>Carex – Racomitrium </I>moss-heath occurs on windswept ground blown clear of snow during winter, and is the most extensive sub-type of the habitat across most of the UK. Where snow-lie builds up, such moss-heath gives way initially to U7&nbsp;<I>Nardus – Carex </I>grass-heath, and then to U8&nbsp;<I>Carex – Polytrichum </I>sedge-heath where snow-lie is more prolonged. The longest lying snow-beds (U11&nbsp;<I>Polytrichum – Kiaeria </I>snow-bed, U12&nbsp;<I>Salix – Racomitrium </I>snow-bed and U14&nbsp;<I>Alchemilla – Sibbaldia </I>dwarf-herb community) are dominated by mosses and hardy herbs. These communities occur around the edges of high plateaux on steep slopes where a snow cornice develops in high corries or in gullies where deep snow accumulates. They can also occur in snow hollows on the highest summits. The&nbsp;<I>Alchemilla – Sibbaldia </I>dwarf-herb community requires a certain amount of base-rich flushing to develop its distinctive flora of small herbs. <I>Carex – Racomitrium </I>moss-heath grades into U9&nbsp;<I>Juncus – Racomitrium </I>rush-heath where exposure is more severe or the substrate unstable, and the latter community represents the habitat type at its highest altitude. </P>\r\n<P>There is much variation in the distribution of the different sub-types across the country. In the western Highlands, <I>Carex – Racomitrium </I>moss-heath is widely distributed and extensive. In the east, <I>Carex – Racomitrium </I>moss-heath is proportionately less abundant, and <I>Carex – Polytrichum </I>sedge-heath and <I>Juncus – Racomitrium </I>rush-heath become more common, especially on the highest hills. <I>Nardus – Carex </I>grass-heaths are extensive throughout the Scottish Highlands, but to the south of the Highlands they become very local and the dominant form of the habitat is <I>Carex</I> <I>– Racomitrium </I>moss-heath. The late-lie snow patch communities (<I>Polytrichum – Kiaeria </I>snow-bed, <I>Salix– Racomitrium </I>snow-bed and <I>Alchemilla– Sibbaldia </I>dwarf-herb community) are rare, being restricted almost exclusively to the higher hills of the Highlands. </P>\r\n<P>The most common sub-type, <I>Carex – Racomitrium </I>moss-heath, varies in species composition depending on the base-richness and instability of the substrate. On relatively stable and acid siliceous rocks the flora is typically species-poor, though a few cushion herbs occur locally, such as moss campion <I>Silene acaulis</I> and thrift <I>Armeria maritima</I>. Localised bands of base-rich rocks support a more varied flora, and a species-rich sub-community develops, supporting a number of rare or local montane plants. The flora of this species-rich moss-heath includes dwarf willow <I>Salix herbacea</I>, alpine lady’s-mantle <I>Alchemilla alpina</I>, moss campion <I>Silene acaulis</I>, thrift <I>Armeria maritima</I>, alpine bistort <I>Persicaria vivipara</I>, sibbaldia <I>Sibbaldia procumbens</I>, spiked wood-rush <I>Luzula spicata</I>, cyphel <I>Minuartia sedoides</I>, the rare montane calcicole mosses <I>Aulacomnium turgidum </I>and <I>Hypnum hamulosum</I>, and the rare foliose lichen <I>Nephroma arcticum</I>. </P>\r\n<P>Open and unstable substrates can also produce an enrichment of the flora and give rise to a similar species-rich sub-type. This can develop on highly windswept ground but occurs most commonly on solifluction terracing in the Scottish Highlands. Alternate freezing and thawing of soil water forms the terracing. Many plants benefit from the instability, which stirs up the soils to release nutrients and counteracts the effects of leaching. A special feature in the UK is that strong winds at high altitude can keep the more exposed risers of the stair-like terraces open, resulting in distinctive bands of vegetation. Norwegian mugwort <I>Artemisia norvegica</I>, which is known from only two mountains in the North-west Highlands, is present in open <I>Carex – Racomitrium </I>moss-heath on solifluction terracing and on open basal rock surfaces.</P>\r\n<P>The communities of the longest-lying snow patches (<I>Polytrichum – Kiaeria </I>snow-bed, <I>Salix – Racomitrium </I>snow-bed and <I>Alchemilla – Sibbaldia </I>dwarf-herb community) are dominated by a range of mosses and hardy herbs tolerant of prolonged snow-cover. Many rare species are found in these snow-beds, including hare’s-foot sedge <I>Carex lachenalii</I>, starwort mouse-ear <I>Cerastium cerastoides</I>, curved wood-rush <I>Luzula arcuata</I>, the bryophytes <I>Conostomum tetragonum</I>, <I>Anthelia juratzkana </I>and <I>Moerckia blyttii</I>, and many lichens growing on rocks or on the ground.</P>\r\n<P>In the Scottish Highlands the sub-types of this habitat type tend to form intimate mosaics with other habitats, the elements of which are ecologically interdependent. For example, U18 <I>Cryptogramma crispa – Athyrium distentifolium</I> snow-bed community (a form of <B>8110 Siliceous scree of the montane to snow levels (<I>Androsacetalia alpinae</I> and <I>Galeopsietalia ladani</I>)</B>)<B> </B>is often associated with snow-bed sub-types of <B>Siliceous alpine and boreal grasslands</B>. Similarly, U13&nbsp;<I>Deschampsia cespitosa – Galium saxatile </I>grasslands, a non-Annex&nbsp;I habitat, can develop on slopes in association with moderately prolonged snow-cover and below areas of melting snow. A sub-type of this grassland with an abundance of the large hypnaceous moss <I>Rhytidiadelphus loreus</I> characteristically occurs in association with <I>Carex – Racomitrium </I>moss-heath on the edges of plateaux in the far north and west. Where there is a transition to more strongly base-rich soils <B>6170 Alpine and subalpine calcareous grasslands</B> occur, including CG12 <I>Festuca ovina – Alchemilla alpina – Silene acaulis </I>dwarf-herb community and CG14 <I>Dryas octopetala – Silene acaulis</I> ledge community.

All forms of <I>Festuco-Brometalia</I> grassland comprise mixtures of grasses and herbs, in which there is at least a moderate representation of calcicolous species. The structural and floristic characteristics of the habitat are strongly influenced by climatic factors and management practices, in particular the intensity of grazing. The main sub-types of these grasslands in the UK correspond to the following NVC types:</P>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI>CG1&nbsp; <I>Festuca ovina – Carlina vulgaris</I> grassland</LI>\r\n<LI>CG2&nbsp; <I>Festuca ovina – Avenula pratensis </I>grassland</LI>\r\n<LI>CG3&nbsp; <I>Bromus erectus</I> grassland</LI>\r\n<LI>CG4&nbsp; <I>Brachypodium pinnatum </I>grassland</LI>\r\n<LI>CG5&nbsp; <I>Bromus erectus – Brachypodium pinnatum </I>grassland</LI>\r\n<LI>CG6&nbsp; <I>Avenula pubescens </I>grassland</LI>\r\n<LI>CG7&nbsp; <I>Festuca ovina – Hieracium pilosella – Thymus praecox/pulegioides</I> grassland</LI>\r\n<LI>CG8&nbsp; <I>Sesleria albicans – Scabiosa columbaria</I> grassland</LI>\r\n<LI>CG9&nbsp; <I>Sesleria albicans – Galium sterneri</I> grassland</LI></UL>\r\n<P>CG2 <I>Festuca </I>– <I>Avenula</I> grassland is widely distributed in grazed calcareous pastures throughout the lowlands of England and Wales. Typical <I>Mesobromion</I> calcicoles, such as meadow oat-grass <I>Avenula pratensis</I>, quaking-grass <I>Briza media</I>, common rock-rose <I>Helianthemum nummularium</I>, salad burnet S<I>anguisorba minor</I> ssp. <I>minor</I> and small scabious <I>Scabiosa columbaria</I>, are well-represented, and are usually accompanied by species with a more Continental distribution, including dwarf thistle <I>Cirsium acaule</I> and squinancywort <I>Asperula cynanchica</I>. Many of the best-known ‘chalk grassland’ rarities occur in this type of <I>Festuco-Brometalia</I>, and some examples are strikingly species-rich.</P>\r\n<P>CG1 <I>Festuca</I> <I>–</I> <I>Carlina</I> and CG7 <I>Festuca – Hieracium – Thymus </I>grasslands both occur on shallow, sharply-draining soils, and comprise open swards in which the representation of <I>Mesobromion</I> species is significantly reduced. Both communities are characterised by the frequency of mouse-ear hawkweed <I>Hieracium pilosella</I>, wild thyme <I>Thymus praecox</I> and annual/biennial species such as yellow-wort <I>Blackstonia perfoliata</I> and thyme-leaved sandwort <I>Arenaria serpyllifolia</I>. The <I>Festuca – Hieracium </I>–<I> Thymus</I> community is centred on areas of low rainfall in eastern England, and shows affinities with arid calcareous grasslands of continental Europe. Conversely, the <I>Festuca</I> <I>–</I> <I>Carlina</I> community occurs only around the coasts of Wales and southern and western England where the climate is warm and mild, and has affinities to the <I>Xerobromion</I> alliance of southern and central Europe. </P>\r\n<P>Where grazing levels are reduced, <I>Festuco-Brometalia</I> swards typically become dominated by coarse grasses (in particular, downy oat-grass <I>Avenula pubescens</I>, tor-grass <I>Brachypodium pinnatum</I> and upright brome <I>Bromus erectus</I>), and plants of smaller stature become correspondingly scarcer. CG3 <I>Bromus </I>grassland, CG4 <I>Brachypodium </I>grassland, CG5 <I>Bromus </I>–<I> Brachypodium </I>grassland, and CG6 <I>Avenula</I> grassland are all widely distributed on chalk and limestone in the English lowlands, and CG3 and CG6 extend locally into Wales. Shrub species, such as hawthorn <I>Crataegus monogyna</I> and blackthorn <I>Prunus spinosa</I>, may become established where grazing is sufficiently light, and may eventually form patches of scrub (e.g. W21 <I>Crataegus monogyna</I> –<I> Hedera helix</I> scrub). Grassland-scrub transitions provide important habitats for a wide range of rare and local British species.</P>\r\n<P>On the limestones of northern England, grasslands dominated by <I>Sesleria albicans</I> are locally abundant.

CG9 <I>Sesleria</I> <I>– Galium</I> grassland is more widespread, and occurs at moderate-high altitudes on Carboniferous Limestone in the Pennines and Lake District. The sub-montane character of the vegetation is shown by the reduced frequency of <I>Mesobromion</I> species, and the presence of limestone bedstraw <I>Galium sterneri</I> and other northern/upland species; some stands are enriched with arctic-alpine rarities. Similar <I>Sesleria</I>-dominated grasslands are also found in Northern Ireland. </P>\r\n<P>Most stands of the upland NVC type CG10&nbsp;<I>Festuca ovina – Agrostis capillaris – Thymus praecox</I> grassland have a very muted calcicolous component and are not referable to the <I>Festuco-Brometalia</I>.

This especially applies to the <I>Carex panicea – Viola riviniana</I> sub-community of U5.

Typically, lowland raised bogs form a raised dome of peat irrigated solely by rainfall. Such rainwater-fed ecosystems are very acid and poor in plant nutrients and typically support a restricted range of species, some of which are otherwise abundant only in the cooler and wetter uplands of the UK.

Such vegetation includes plants such as the bog-mosses <I>Sphagnum</I> spp., cottongrasses <I>Eriophorum</I> spp., heather <I>Calluna vulgaris</I> and other ericaceous plants, and the carnivorous sundews <I>Drosera </I>spp. Under some circumstances purple moor-grass <I>Molinia caerulea</I> is also peat-forming.

Classical descriptions of the ecosystem show raised bogs as having a discrete lens-shaped dome of peat with flat or imperceptibly sloping topography with a halo of fen vegetation in the zone where water draining the bog meets that from adjoining mineral soils. This is known as the lagg. A characteristic of the lagg zone is that normally it has more available plant nutrients, is more alkaline and hence shows greater species diversity, with a preponderance of sedge <I>Carex </I>spp. As a result of peat-digging and other activities, no example of raised bog that conforms exactly to this model is now known in Europe.

Other morphological types are less obviously defined. Eccentric mires, of which there are possibly only three in the UK, might be thought of as extreme, fan-shaped forms of valleyside mire that abut mineral ground at their upslope margins and have dramatic surface patterning aligned at right angles to the slope. Ladder fens form an integral part of some blanket bogs and have a characteristic surface patterning, with narrow pools and intervening low, narrow ridges parallel to the contours. Associated with this structure is a more species-rich flora than that of the surrounding mire expanse. This is due to local flushing of mineral nutrients through these fen areas, in contrast to the surrounding vegetation, which receives all its nutrients through precipitation, i.e. is ombrotrophic. Ladder fens may also be referable to <B>7140 Transition mires and quaking bogs.</P>\r\n<P>Blanket bogs</B> show a complex pattern of variation related to climatic factors, particularly illustrated by the variety of patterning of the bog surface in different parts of the UK.

In general, the proportion of surface patterning occupied by permanent pools increases to the north and west, although the precise shape and pattern of pools appears to depend on local topography as well as geographical location. Variety within the bog vegetation mirrors this pattern and is also affected by altitude. Similarly, the number of associated habitats and communities, such as springs, flushes, fens and heath, is greater in the milder, wetter and geologically and topographically more complex north and west. </P>\r\n<P>‘Active’ is defined as supporting a significant area of vegetation that is normally peat-forming.
