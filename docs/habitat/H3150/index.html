<h4>Description and ecological characteristics</h4>
<p><B>
<P>Natural eutrophic lakes</B> have nutrient levels that are higher than those of oligotrophic, dystrophic or mesotrophic lakes, resulting in higher natural productivity, and are typically species-rich. However, many such lakes have been damaged by over-enrichment with nutrients, resulting in hypertrophic conditions and a reduction in species-richness. </P>
<P>In the UK <B>natural eutrophic lakes</B> typically contain aquatic macrophyte communities dominated by pondweeds <I>Potamogeton</I> spp., spiked water-milfoil <I>Myriophyllum spicatum</I>, yellow water-lily <I>Nuphar lutea</I>, and occasionally by associations of stoneworts <I>Chara</I> spp. Except in the most northerly areas, many eutrophic lakes are fringed by reedmace<I> – </I>common reed <I>Scirpo – Phragmitetum</I> associations. More northern shorelines may have reed-canary grass – shoreweed – spike-rush<I> Phalaris – Littorella – Eleocharis</I> associations. Most eutrophic lakes are formed on soft rocks but wave-washed rocky shores form an important part of the habitat on larger lakes. </P>
<P>Three<I> </I>main sub-types of<I> </I>eutrophic lake can be identified:</P>
<OL type=i>
<LI>southern eutrophic lakes</LI>
<LI>northern or western eutrophic lakes</LI>
<LI>coastal eutrophic lakes.</LI></OL></p>

<h4>European status and distribution</h4>
<p><B>
<P>Natural eutrophic lakes</B> are now uncommon in the EU, due to pollution, but the exact status of the habitat type is unknown. </P></p>

<h4>UK status and distribtution</h4> 
<p>Click <a href=/habitat/H3150/map>here</a> view UK distribution of this species</p>
<p>
<P>In the UK <B>natural eutrophic lakes</B> are comparatively rare, although they have a wide and scattered distribution. Very few examples occur above 300&nbsp;m. <I>Hydrocharition</I>-type vegetation is rare in lakes and in the UK seems to be confined to Northern Ireland. In the rest of the UK the most complete expression of this community type is found in the ditch systems of the Norfolk Broads. In eastern England most of the lakes are polluted, but the peripheral grazing marsh and ditch systems contain relict eutrophic communities.</P></p>

<div class="cell large-12 small-12" style="padding-bottom: 1.5em">Llyn Dinam is a coastal eutrophic lake in north Wales. Common reed <i>Phragmites australis</i>, and to a lesser extent common club-rush <i>Scirpus lacustris</i> ssp. <i>lacustris</i>, dominate the shoreline. Rigid hornwort <i>Ceratophyllum demersum</i> is abundant in shallow open water, often in association with autumnal starwort <i>Callitriche hermaphroditica</i> and ivy-leaved duckweed <i>Lemna trisulca</i>. The white and yellow water-lilies <i>Nymphaea alba</i> and <i>Nuphar lutea</i> dominate in a sheltered arm on the west side. Fennel-leaved pondweed <i>Potamogeton pectinatus</i>, perfoliate pondweed <i>P. perfoliatus</i> and lesser pondweed <i>P. pusillus</i> have been recorded. Stoneworts <i>Chara</i> spp. are present. Water chemistry characteristics are consistent with those expected in eutrophic lakes, including relatively high pH, alkalinity and phosphorus levels.

It is located in the south-west corner of the island of Tiree. Loch a’ Phuill is one of the best examples of a coastal eutrophic loch, with a catchment including acid grassland/heathland on peaty soils and machair landforms protecting it from any serious modifications. The loch supports a particularly diverse aquatic plant flora with several species indicative of the sandy substrate and maritime influence on this eutrophic waterbody, particularly in its south-west area that is dominated by stoneworts <i>Chara</i> spp. The loch also supports several species of pondweed including the nationally scarce fen pondweed <i>Potamogeton coloratus</i>, and slender-leaved pondweed <i>P. filiformis</i>. Of further interest is the loch’s very high pH level, indicating the liming influence of windblown shell-sand, and high conductivity reflecting sea-water spray affecting the site.</div></div>

<div class="cell large-12 small-12" style="padding-bottom: 1.5em">Loch of Isbister is an excellent example of a shallow moderate-sized naturally eutrophic loch. Formerly the Loch of Isbister was more extensive, but encroachment by peripheral vegetation and peat has resulted in the development of a high-quality basin-mire complex, with excellent examples of open-water transition plant communities. The loch supports a rich plant flora typical of the <i>Magnopotamion</i> type, with plants able to grow in the centre of the loch due to its shallow nature, including abundant stoneworts <i>Chara</i> spp. and pondweeds <i>Potamogeton</i> spp. The loch is rich in northern species and is the most northerly site for <b>natural eutrophic lakes</b> in the UK.</div></div>

<div class="cell large-12 small-12" style="padding-bottom: 1.5em">Loch of Wester is a high-quality naturally eutrophic loch which drains a large peatland catchment in Caithness, flowing into the North Sea through Keiss Links. It developed after the sand-bar at its outflow formed an impoundment, indicating its recent geological origin. The eutrophic conditions in the loch are derived from the Old Red Sandstone which is found throughout its catchment. The loch lies in the northern north-east Scottish Highlands where low-intensity land-use has protected it from any serious modifications. The plant species assemblage in the loch indicates that it lies towards the lower end of the nutrient-rich category, adding diversity to the suite of sites selected as <b>Natural eutrophic lakes with <i>Magnopotamion</i> or <i>Hydrocharition</i>-type vegetation</b>. The pondweeds include the nationally scarce slender-leaved pondweed <i>Potamogeton filiformis</i>, as well as various-leaved pondweed <i>P. gramineus</i>, fennel pondweed <i>P. pectinatus</i>, perfoliate pondweed <i>P. perfoliatus</i> and lesser pondweed <i>P. pusillus</i>.</div></div>

It is the largest of a series of kettle hole lochs overlying the Old Red Sandstone of the Caithness plain in the north of Scotland. Loch Watten is representative of a northern or western <b>natural eutrophic lake</b> of glacial origin. The flora contains stonewort – pondweed – water-milfoil <i>Characeae</i> – <i>Potamogeton</i> – <i>Myriophyllum</i> associations, with pondweeds well-represented, and is rich in northern species.

The lochs are therefore surrounded by machair landforms and represent high-quality naturally eutrophic waterbodies that reflect a strong maritime influence and have been protected from any major modifications. Lochs of this type are Loch nam Feithean and Loch Croghearraidh. The lochs support a diverse aquatic plant flora typical of eutrophic lochs that includes the rare slender naiad <i>Najas flexilis</i>, slender-leaved pondweed <i>Potamogeton filiformis</i>, common duckweed <i>Lemna minor</i> (which is rare in the local area) and stoneworts <i>Chara</i> spp.</div></div>

<div class="cell large-12 small-12" style="padding-bottom: 1.5em">South Uist in the Outer Hebrides contains a series of coastal <b>natural eutrophic lakes</b> formed on calcareous marine sediments on the machair plain. These lakes are the best examples of their type in the UK, owing to the richness of their flora. Stoneworts <i>Chara</i> spp. and pondweeds <i>Potamogeton</i> spp. dominate the aquatic community, and shorelines contain spike-rush <i>Eleocharis</i> associations. Lochs of this type within the site are: Loch Roag; West Loch Ollay; Loch Ardvule; Loch Stilligarry; and Loch na Liana Móire. The South Uist machair supports a unique transition from oligotrophic lochs on peatland towards the centre of the island, through mixed oligotrophic and mesotrophic lochs where peat ‘blackland’ meets machair, to eutrophic lochs over calcareous sand and brackish lochs on the west coast. This site has been selected for many of these Annex I habitat types in their own right.</div></div>

Although artificial, having arisen from peat digging in medieval times, these lakes and the ditches in areas of fen and drained marshlands support relict vegetation of the original Fenland flora, and collectively this site contains one of the richest assemblages of rare and local aquatic species in the UK. The stonewort – pondweed – water-milfoil – water-lily <i>Characeae</i> – <i>Potamogeton</i> – <i>Myriophyllum</i> – <i>Nuphar</i> associations are well-represented, as are club-rush – common reed <i>Scirpo</i> – <i>Phragmitetum</i> associations. Some Broads, such as Martham North, Martham South and Upton Broad, have escaped the problem of enrichment that has so affected the flora and fauna on many of the other Broads. Others, such as Hickling Broad, are recovering from these effects as a result of remedial measures. Martham North, Martham South, Upton and Hickling Broad contain holly-leaved naiad <i>Najas marina</i>, a national rarity. The dyke (ditch) systems support vegetation characterised by water-soldier <i>Stratiotes aloides</i>, whorled water-milfoil <i>Myriophyllum verticillatum</i> and broad-leaved pondweed <i>Potamogeton natans</i>.</div></div>

The Tiree Machair cSAC comprises four discrete areas located in the central and north western areas of the island of Tiree. Loch Bhasapol and other lochs on the machair plain represent high quality naturally eutrophic waterbodies that reflect a strong maritime influence. The eutrophic condition of the waterbodies is derived from the sand deposits and dunes that are prevalent throughout the site. The lochs support a diverse aquatic plant flora with several species indicative of the maritime influence, including brackish water-crowfoot <i>Ranunculus baudotii</i> that has a restricted UK and European distribution. The site also supports eight species of pondweed, including the nationally scarce fen pondweed <i>Potamogeton coloratus</i>, and slender-leaved pondweed <i>P. filiformis</i>, together with the locally rare fennel pondweed <i>P. pectinatus</i>.</div></div>
