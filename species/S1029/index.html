<h4>Description and ecological characteristics</h4>
<p>
<P>The <B>freshwater pearl mussel <I>Margaritifera margaritifera</B></I> grows to 140&nbsp;mm in length, and burrows into sandy substrates, often between boulders and pebbles, in fast-flowing rivers and streams. It requires cool, well-oxygenated soft water free of pollution or turbidity. The mussel spends its larval, or glochidial, stage attached to the gills of salmonid fishes. The larvae attach themselves during mid to late summer and drop off the following spring to settle in the riverbed gravel where they grow to adulthood.</P>
<P>Population declines have been caused by factors such as pearl-fishing, pollution, acidification, organic enrichment, siltation, river engineering, and declining salmonid stocks. An additional serious threat in parts of mainland Europe is predation by introduced muskrat <I>Ondatra zibethicus</I> (Zahner-Meike &amp; Hanson 2001). <B><I>M.&nbsp;margaritifera</B></I> is now a rare species whose conservation is giving rise to concern, and its increasing rarity in mainland Europe gives extra significance to UK populations.</P>
<P>As this species does not reach reproductive maturity until at least 12 years old and may live for over 120 years (Bauer 1992; Beasley &amp; Roberts 1999), population age-structure is vitally important when assessing viability. The presence of juveniles (a feature essential to the long-term sustainability of mussel populations) is a clear indicator of the structural and functional features of the habitat required for the survival and reproduction of the species. </P></p>

<h4>European status and distribution</h4>
<p>
<P>The <B>freshwater pearl mussel <I>Margaritifera margaritifera</B></I> is widely distributed in Europe, Fennoscandia and north-eastern North America, but has suffered serious decline and is threatened with extinction or is highly vulnerable in every part of its former range. It is listed as ‘vulnerable’ by IUCN, but is believed to be even more threatened. Outside Britain and Ireland, recruiting populations of international importance survive in probably fewer than 50 rivers world-wide (Young <I>et al</I>. 2001). Only a few viable populations survive in mainland Europe, most remaining continental populations consisting of mussels at least 30 years old with few signs of recent recruitment – although an apparent absence of juveniles may in some cases be partly due to difficulties in surveying (Hastie &amp; Cosgrove 2002). A distinct hard-water form, <I>M.&nbsp;margaritifera durrovensis</I>, is restricted to a few river systems in southern Ireland. </P></p>

<h4>UK status and distribution</h4> 
<p>Click <a href=/species/S1029/map>here</a> view UK distribution of this species</p>
<p><B><I>
<P>Margaritifera margaritifera</B></I> was formerly widespread throughout western and northern parts of Great Britain. However, England and Wales are each now believed to support only a single recruiting population. In Northern Ireland the species formerly occurred widely in several catchments, but is now restricted to a few sites. Many UK rivers now contain only scattered individuals, with no juvenile mussels recorded; such populations may become extinct due to lack of recruitment. Despite serious declines in both range and total population, Scotland is the remaining European stronghold for <B><I>M.&nbsp;margaritifera</B></I>, supporting functional populations in over 50 rivers, mainly in the Highlands. </P></p>

It is a moderately large river, being ultra-oligotrophic in its upland reaches within the Republic of Ireland, before gradually becoming oligotrophic and oligo-mesotrophic through its middle and lower reaches within Northern Ireland. The <b>freshwater pearl mussel <i>Margaritifera margaritifera</i></b> population, which is estimated to have a minimum number of 10,000 individuals, is confined to 6 km of undisturbed river channel in the middle section of the river.

<div class="cell large-12 small-12" style="padding-bottom: 1.5em">The River Spey is a large Scottish east coast river that drains an extensive upland catchment and supports an outstanding freshwater pearl mussel population in its middle to lower reaches. In parts of the River Spey, extremely dense mussel colonies have been recorded (225&nbsp;m<SUP><FONT size=2>2</SUP></FONT>) and the total population is estimated at several million. As the population also shows evidence of recent recruitment and a high proportion of juveniles, the River Spey is considered to support a pearl mussel population of great international significance.</div></div>

It is a moderately large river with nutrient conditions that range from oligo-mesotrophic to mesotrophic. The <b>freshwater pearl mussel <i>Margaritifera margaritifera</i></b> population, which is estimated to have a minimum number of 1,000 individuals, is confined to 7.5 km of undisturbed river channel in its middle reaches.
