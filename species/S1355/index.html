            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p>
<P>The <B>otter <I>Lutra lutra</B></I> is a semi-aquatic mammal, which occurs in a wide range of ecological conditions, including inland freshwater and coastal areas (particularly in Scotland). Populations in coastal areas utilise shallow, inshore marine areas for feeding but also require fresh water for bathing and terrestrial areas for resting and breeding holts. Coastal otter habitat ranges from sheltered wooded inlets to more open, low-lying coasts. Inland populations utilise a range of running and standing freshwaters. These must have an abundant supply of food (normally associated with high water quality), together with suitable habitat, such as vegetated river banks, islands, reedbeds and woodland, which are used for foraging, breeding and resting. </P></p>

    <h2>European status and distribution</h2>
    <p>
<P>The <B>otter <I>Lutra lutra</B></I> was once widespread in Europe, but populations declined sharply during the 1960s and 1970s due to pollution, exacerbated by hunting and habitat loss. Currently it has a rather discontinuous distribution with strong populations in Greece, Spain, Portugal and much of eastern Europe. Over most of continental western Europe the species is scarce to extinct, but reintroduction or restocking projects are in progress in several countries. </P></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>UK status and distribution</h2> 
    <p>
<P>Historically, <B>otters <I>Lutra lutra</B></I> occurred over most of the UK. However, persecution, habitat loss and, more recently, the impact of toxic organochlorine insecticides caused a marked reduction in the range of the species. At present, the majority of the otter population in Great Britain occurs in Scotland, with a significant proportion of this number being found in the north and west of the country. Other strong populations survive in Wales and Ireland. The otter is still scarce over much of England, where the highest concentrations are in the south-west. However, recent surveys suggest that the otter population is recovering well and recolonising parts of its former range.</P></p>

        <h2>Site selection rationale</h2>
        <p>The SAC series reflects the present discontinuous distribution of otters Lutra lutra in the UK. Sites that are known to support high densities have been selected to represent the current strongholds of the population. The sites selected also cover the ecologically variable conditions in which the species is found across its range. As well as a known high density of otters, sites selected have good quality habitat features necessary for feeding and breeding. This is demonstrated by a known record of continuous occupation of the site, even, in England, during the period of population decline. Recent research has demonstrated that this approach has also ensured good coverage of the main lines of genetic variation in British otters.&#xD;&#xA;The otter population is widespread and individuals are wide-ranging, normally occurring at low densities, which is reflected in the relatively large number of sites where the species occurs as a qualifying feature, but is not a primary reason for site selection. The selected sites include some very extensive areas (totalling over 175,000&amp;nbsp;ha). While the SAC series makes a contribution to securing favourable conservation status for this Annex&amp;nbsp;II species, wider countryside measures, in particular Biodiversity Action Plan implementation, additionally contribute to conservation of this species in the UK.</p>

The Camel represents <b>otter <i>Lutra lutra</i></b> in its main stronghold in England in the south-west of the country. Surveys have indicated a dense population along this river. Records show that these populations persisted even during the period when the otter was in serious decline over much of the rest of its range in England, and this area has acted as a nucleus for recolonisation of other parts of England. The river and its tributaries represent the more upland as well as lowland habitat types utilised by otters, satisfying requirements for adequate food supply throughout the year.

The Spey represents an important <B>otter <I>Lutra lutra</I></B> site in Scotland, with good quality freshwater habitat. Surveys have identified high levels of otter presence throughout the Spey catchment. Riverine habitat features which are known to be important to otters are present, such as reedbeds and islands, and populations of important prey species are relatively healthy.

    <div>
The River Usk is an important site for <b>otters <i>Lutra lutra</i></b> in Wales. They are believed to be using most parts of the main river, from Newport upstream, and in recent years signs of otters have increased. In 1991 an expansion upstream of known otter ranges was recorded on several tributaries, including the Honddu, Senni and Crai. The upper Usk may have acted as a ‘refuge’ during the decline of the 1950s, and had subsequently acted as a ‘source’ population for recolonisation of south-east Wales.    </div>

    <div>
The Wye holds the densest and most well-established <b>otter <i>Lutra lutra</i></b> population in Wales, representative of otters occurring in lowland freshwater habitats in the borders of Wales. The river has bank-side vegetation cover, abundant food supply, clean water and undisturbed areas of dense scrub suitable for breeding, making it particularly favourable as otter habitat.

Sunart supports a relatively high density of <b>otter <i>Lutra lutra</i></b>. Records show that the site has supported consistently strong populations, indicating that the habitat is suitable for the species. The site is representative of coastal otter populations on the west coast of Scotland, which is a stronghold for the species. The otters mainly forage in the extensive wrack and kelp beds that occur throughout shallow areas of Loch Sunart and which serve as habitat for important prey species. Over 1400 otter holts, typically in areas of dense vegetation and rock boulder cover, have been recorded in the terrestrial areas bordering the edge of the loch and on the main islands. There is also a large influx of freshwater from numerous streams and rivers around the site which are important to the otter for washing.     </div>

Upper Lough Erne consists of a large eutrophic lake with very extensive associated wetland habitats that holds a dense and large population of otters. In addition the surrounding countryside is rich in relatively unpolluted rivers and lakes and has a high density of semi-natural habitats, especially wetlands, supporting the otter population within the site.    </div>

The <b>otter <i>Lutra lutra</i></b> population in Shetland is one of the most intensively-studied in Europe. Not only are the Shetland animals morphologically distinct from their mainland counterparts, they are also believed to be genetically distinct. In addition, specialists consider that the populations are possibly the densest in Europe. Therefore, the Shetland population is in many ways unique, and is considered of special importance in a UK context. Within Shetland, the Yell Sound area has the highest density of otter. Indeed the site is believed to support more than 2% of the entire GB otter population. The site consists of a complex of islands and coastline, selected to include the areas of highest otter density. The areas are characterised by low-lying peaty coastlines with large numbers of otter holts and easy access to fresh water. The adjacent marine areas have extensive algal beds which are used for foraging.    </div>
