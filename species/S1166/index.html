            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p>
<P>The <B>great crested newt <I>Triturus cristatus</B></I> is the largest native British newt, reaching up to around 17 cm length. It has a granular skin texture (caused by glands which contain toxins making it unpalatable to predators), and in the terrestrial phase is dark grey, brown or black over most of the body, with a bright yellow/orange and black belly pattern. Adult males have jagged crests running along the body and tail. Newts require aquatic habitats for breeding. Eggs are laid singly on pond vegetation in spring, and larvae develop over summer to emerge in August – October, normally taking 2–4 years to reach maturity. Juveniles spend most time on land, and all terrestrial phases may range a considerable distance from breeding sites. </P>
<P>Breeding sites are mainly medium-sized ponds, though ditches and other waterbody types may also be used less frequently. Ponds with ample aquatic vegetation (which is used for egg-laying) seem to be favoured. Great crested newts do not require very high water quality, but are normally found in ponds with a circum-neutral pH. Broad habitat type varies greatly, the most frequent being pastoral and arable farmland, woodland, scrub, and grassland. There are also populations in coastal dunes and shingle structures. Great crested newts can be found in rural, urban and post-industrial settings, with populations less able to thrive where there are high degrees of fragmentation. The connectivity of the landscape is important, since great crested newts often occur in metapopulations that encompass a cluster of several or many ponds. This helps ensure the survival of populations even if sub-populations are affected by, for example, pond desiccation or fish introductions. Climate may influence the range edge at the north of its distribution in Scotland, but other ecological or landscape factors such as pond density are probably more important in determining distribution across the main part of its British range.</P></p>

    <h2>European status and distribution</h2>
    <p>
<P>The <B>great crested newt <I>Triturus cristatus</B></I> is found widely throughout northern Europe. Populations are thought to have declined dramatically throughout the species’ European range.</P></p>
</div>

<div class="section">
    <h2>UK status and distribution</h2> 
    <p>
<P>The <B>great crested newt <I>Triturus cristatus</B></I> is widespread throughout much of England and Wales, but occurs only sparsely in south-west England, mid Wales and Scotland. It is absent from Northern Ireland. The total UK population is relatively large and is distributed over sites that vary greatly in their ecological character. One estimate has put the national population at around 400,000 animals in 18,000 breeding sites. Many of the largest populations are centred on disused mineral-extraction sites, but lowland farmland forms the majority of great crested newt habitat in the UK.</P></p>

        <h2>Site selection rationale</h2>
        <p>Sites have been selected where there is evidence of a relatively large and robust population of great crested newts Triturus cristatus based on reliable recent survey data. Sites which either lack reliable population estimates or support small populations have not been selected. The SAC series represents the wide range of habitat types used by the species, and includes representative sites in semi-natural and more anthropogenic settings, as well as taking into account different vegetation and geology types. The selected sites include ponds in pastoral and arable farmland, woodland, grassland, coastal habitats, and disused mineral-extraction sites. Geographical representation of different areas within the species&#x2019; range has also been taken into account.&#xD;&#xA;While the SAC series makes a contribution to securing favourable conservation status for this Annex II species, wider measures are also necessary to support its conservation in the UK, including those identified under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, such as pond creation and management.</p>

<b>Great crested newts <i>Triturus cristatus</i></b> breed in a large pond set in a depression in grazed pasture. This main breeding pond has a water level that fluctuates widely, sometimes leading to pond desiccation. As a result, there is relatively little aquatic vegetation but egg-laying occurs and recruitment is successful intermittently; however, a large population is present, demonstrating this species’ ability to thrive in temporary pond sites.

Situated east of Warrington, this site comprises parts of an extensive disused brickworks excavated in glacial boulder clay. The excavation has left a series of hollows, which have filled with water since workings ceased in the 1960s, leading to a variety of pond sizes. New ponds have also been created more recently for wildlife and amenity purposes. <b>Great crested newt <i>Triturus cristatus</i></b> are known to occur in at least 20 ponds across the site. The site also supports species-rich grassland, scrub and mature secondary woodland.    </div>

    <div>
The pond cluster is mostly within an area of planted, mature conifer forest, with open areas of mire and some heath also present. Records for ‘Turflundie fire pond’ date back to the mid/late 1960s. There is also a good record of presence in Lady Loch SSSI. More recently there has been a programme of pond creation on the site, specifically geared to improving the habitat quality for <b>great crested newt <i>Triturus cristatus</i></b>. They have now been recorded breeding in eight ponds and recorded as present at a further two ponds. This is the most northerly known cluster of great crested newt ponds in the UK and is at about 250 m above sea level. Turflundie Wood is therefore an important representative site near to the extreme northern part of the species’ UK range.    </div>
