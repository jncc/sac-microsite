            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p>
<P>These extensive peatlands have formed in areas where there is a climate of high rainfall and a low level of evapotranspiration, allowing peat to develop not only in wet hollows but over large expanses of undulating ground.</P>
<P>The blanketing of the ground with a variable depth of peat gives the habitat type its name and results in the various morphological types according to their topographical position, e.g. saddle mires, watershed mires, valleyside mires. Other morphological types are less obviously defined. Eccentric mires, of which there are possibly only three in the UK, might be thought of as extreme, fan-shaped forms of valleyside mire that abut mineral ground at their upslope margins and have dramatic surface patterning aligned at right angles to the slope. Ladder fens form an integral part of some blanket bogs and have a characteristic surface patterning, with narrow pools and intervening low, narrow ridges parallel to the contours. Associated with this structure is a more species-rich flora than that of the surrounding mire expanse. This is due to local flushing of mineral nutrients through these fen areas, in contrast to the surrounding vegetation, which receives all its nutrients through precipitation, i.e. is ombrotrophic. Ladder fens may also be referable to <B>7140 Transition mires and quaking bogs.</P>
<P>Blanket bogs</B> show a complex pattern of variation related to climatic factors, particularly illustrated by the variety of patterning of the bog surface in different parts of the UK. Such climatic factors also influence the floristic composition of bog vegetation. Many of the bogs in the Hebrides and Northern Ireland have affinities to types in western Ireland and thus exhibit more oceanic aspects of the range of variation, while those sites towards the eastern limit of <B>blanket bog</B> formation show more continental affinities.</P>
<P>An important element in defining variation is the relative proportion of pools on the bog surface. In general, the proportion of surface patterning occupied by permanent pools increases to the north and west, although the precise shape and pattern of pools appears to depend on local topography as well as geographical location. Variety within the bog vegetation mirrors this pattern and is also affected by altitude. Similarly, the number of associated habitats and communities, such as springs, flushes, fens and heath, is greater in the milder, wetter and geologically and topographically more complex north and west. </P>
<P>‘Active’ is defined as supporting a significant area of vegetation that is normally peat-forming. Typical species include the important peat-forming species, such as bog-mosses <I>Sphagnum</I> spp. and cottongrasses <I>Eriophorum </I>spp., or purple moor-grass <I>Molinia caerulea</I> in certain circumstances, together with heather <I>Calluna vulgaris </I>and other ericaceous species. Thus sites, particularly those at higher altitude, characterised by extensive erosion features, may still be classed as ‘active’ if they otherwise support extensive areas of typical bog vegetation, and especially if the erosion gullies show signs of recolonisation. </P>
<P>The most abundant NVC <B>blanket bog</B> types are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>M17&nbsp; <I>Scirpus cespitosus – Eriophorum</I> <I>vaginatum</I> blanket mire </LI>
<LI>M18&nbsp; <I>Erica tetralix – Sphagnum papillosum</I> raised and blanket mire </LI>
<LI>M19&nbsp; <I>Calluna vulgaris – Eriophorum vaginatum</I> blanket mire </LI>
<LI>M20&nbsp; <I>Eriophorum vaginatum</I> blanket and raised mire </LI>
<LI>M25<I>&nbsp; Molinia caerulea – Potentilla erecta</I> mire. </LI></UL>
<P>M15&nbsp;<I>Scirpus cespitosus – Erica tetralix</I> wet heath may also occur on blanket peat, but stands of <I>Scirpus</I> <I>– Erica</I> wet heath on shallower peats (&lt;0.5&nbsp;m depth) are generally referable to Annex&nbsp;I type <B>H4010 Northern Atlantic wet heaths with <I>Erica tetralix</B></I>. Hollows within blanket bog often contain M1&nbsp;<I>Sphagnum auriculatum</I>, M2 <I>Sphagnum cuspidatum/recurvum</I> or M3 <I>Eriophorum angustifolium</I> bog pool communities, and, particularly in Scotland, there may be <B>3160</B> <B>Natural dystrophic lakes and ponds</B>. <B>7150 Depressions on peat substrates of the <I>Rhynchosporion</I> </B>occur locally around the margins of bog pools.</P>
<P>Heather <I>Calluna vulgaris</I>, cross-leaved heath <I>Erica tetralix</I>, cottongrasses <I>Eriophorum </I>spp., deergrass <I>Trichophorum cespitosum </I>and bog-mosses such as <I>S.&nbsp;papillosum</I>, <I>S.&nbsp;tenellum </I>and <I>S.&nbsp;capillifolium</I> are characteristic of <B>blanket bog</B> throughout its UK range. Other species are more characteristic of, or more abundant in, certain areas. For example, the higher, drier eastern bogs typically support a higher proportion of hare’s-tail cottongrass <I>Eriophorum vaginatum </I>and bilberry <I>Vaccinium myrtillus </I>than those further west. Similarly, purple moor-grass <I>Molinia caerulea </I>and bog-myrtle <I>Myrica gale </I>are much more widespread and typical on western bogs. The distribution of some of the rarer bog-mosses, for example <I>Sphagnum imbricatum </I>and <I>S.&nbsp;fuscum</I>, is less readily associated with geography and may relate more to past management than to climate.</P></p>

Ben Wyvis lies between the high-altitude sites of the Grampian Mountains and the northern peatlands of Caithness and Sutherland, and supports species and features typical of both these areas. <b>Blanket bog</b> occurs across a wide altitudinal range but of particular note are the extensive areas of uneroded high-altitude bog supporting cloudberry <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i>, alpine bearberry <i>Arctostaphylos alpinus</i> and dwarf birch <i>Betula nana</i>.    </div>

    </b>
    <div>
Berwyn supports the most extensive tract of near-natural <b>blanket bog</b> in Wales. Much of the <b>blanket bog</b> vegetation is dominated by NVC type M19 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> blanket mire, with crowberry <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> and an often extensive hypnoid moss cover; within this community cloudberry <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i> is found close to the southernmost limit of its British range. On deeper peats, there are smaller stands of M18 <i>Erica tetralix</i> – <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i> mire, some of which exhibit distinctive surface patterning. The mire vegetation shows transitions to heather-dominated dwarf-shrub heath.    </div>

    <div>
This complex is part of what was once the largest continuous tract of <b>Blanket bogs</b> across northern England and is particularly important for the quality of the transition it represents between blanket bog and raised mire. Although much of the land has been afforested, significant areas of the original bog remain throughout the forested expanse and these have been selected to represent this habitat type in northern England. The climate is wetter here than in some other parts of northern England, and this is reflected in the composition of the vegetation, which is dominated by species of cottongrass <i>Eriophorum</i> and a reduced cover of heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>. At Butterburn Flow the wetter climate is also emphasised by quite distinct surface patterning of <i>Sphagnum</i> hollows separated by <i>Sphagnum</i> ridges in the largest of the open areas. It is a very good example of the <i>Sphagnum</i>-rich cross-leaved heath <i>Erica tetralix</i> and <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i> vegetation type.    </div>

Caenlochan contains extensive areas of high altitude <b>Blanket bogs</b> representative of the eastern Highlands of Scotland. The blanket bog belongs to the M19 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> blanket mire community and is extensive between 700 m and 900 m altitude. Above about 800 m, where the bogs occupy an extensive high plateau, heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> is replaced by cowberry <i>Vaccinium vitis-idaea</i> and the montane dwarf-shrubs crowberry <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> ssp. <i>hermaphroditum</i> and bog bilberry <i>Vaccinium uliginosum</i>. These montane blanket bogs show floristic affinities with mountain bogs in Scandinavia.    </div>

        Highlands and Islands, North Eastern Scotland
    </b>
    <div>
The Cairngorms support extensive areas of <b>blanket bog</b> both on the lower slopes, where it gives way to <b>4010 Northern Atlantic wet heath</b> and <b>4030 European dry heaths</b> as the gradient increases, and at high altitude. This contrasts with most other sites, which tend to be dominated by bogs of more limited altitudinal range. At low altitude bogs occur along valleysides and in depressions amongst the undulating glacial deposits and there are good examples of M18 <i>Erica tetralix</i> – <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i> blanket mire. Where bogs occur within or adjacent to <b>91C0 Caledonian forest</b>, Scots pine <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> is often present, forming stands of <b>91D0 Bog woodland</b>. These bogs are generally rich in the bog-mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> and <i>S. papillosum</i>. On the Cairngorms blanket bog probably extends to a higher altitude than on any other SAC in the UK, around 1000 m. The bogs at higher altitude are M19 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> blanket mire and some of these are moderately extensive on the gently sloping plateaux below the mountain tops. Above about 850 m, heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> disappears from the blanket bog and is replaced by mountain crowberry <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> ssp. <i>hermaphroditum</i> and bog bilberry <i>Vaccinium uliginosum</i>. Dwarf birch <i>Betula nana</i> occurs locally in this higher-altitude bog. Lichens of the reindeer group (<i>Cladonia arbuscula</i> and <i>C. rangiferina</i>) are abundant, and the Cairngorms have some of the best examples of lichen-rich bogs.    </div>

    <div>
The scale and diversity of the Caithness and Sutherland peatlands in northern Scotland make them unique in Europe. They form the largest peat mass in the UK and are three times larger than any other peatland area in either Britain or Ireland. The site is important because of the considerable abundance of large (several square kilometres) continuous areas of <i>Sphagnum</i> carpets and hummocks, including <i>Sphagnum fuscum</i>, <i>S. imbricatum</i> and <i>S. pulchrum</i>, and for its numerous intact pool systems. Not only are these features usually rare and localised on other bog systems in the UK, but a very high proportion of this ground remains undisturbed. The vegetation is mainly cross-leaved heath <i>Erica tetralix</i> with <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i> as well as deergrass <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i> and hare’s-tail cottongrass <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> blanket mire. Freshwater pools and lochans are an integral component of the mire expanse.    </div>

Carn nan Tri-Tighearnan lies on a plateau at more than 600 m altitude. It is an example of an upland bog in the eastern Scottish Highlands. It is characterised by cool climate conditions and extreme ‘wetness’. Dense sheets of lichen-rich <b>blanket bog</b> are dominated by species of reindeer-moss lichen <i>Cladonia</i>. Such bog is very similar in character to areas of peat formation in central and eastern Norway. Other vegetation on this site consists of a dwarf-shrub cover, beneath which can be found relatively continuous carpets of <i>Sphagnum</i>. Surface patterning resulting from combinations of high-ridges and hummocks is evident in many places.    </div>

Carn – Glenshane Pass represents a large area of intact <b>blanket bog</b> within the Sperrin Mountains in Northern Ireland. The area is characterised by undulating topography and includes a large, well-developed hummock and pool system and extensive eroding hagg complexes within a thick mantle of blanket peat. The peatland vegetation generally supports a high dwarf-shrub cover of heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> and cross-leaved heath <i>Erica tetralix</i> together with a mixture of sedges including deergrass <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i> and hare’s-tail cottongrass <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>. Bog-mosses are well-represented and include the hummock-forming species <i>Sphagnum imbricatum</i> and <i>S. fuscum</i>. Areas of flushed peat are more species-rich and include a variety of additional plants, including bog-sedge <i>Carex limosa</i> and dioecious sedge <i>C. dioica</i>.    </div>

Claish Moss lies along the southern shore of Loch Shiel, while neighbouring Kentra Moss opens into Kentra Bay. They are representative of a highly oceanic <b>blanket bog</b> type found on the north-west coast of Scotland. These are two of the only three known ‘eccentric’ mires in Britain and are selected because of the rarity of this bog form. ‘Eccentric’ bogs are characterised by spectacular surface patterns and are similar in structure to types more commonly found in central Scandinavia, generally as raised bog. The development of this type is very unusual in a blanket bog landscape and is of special interest. The species composition is very rich, with 14 <i>Sphagnum</i> species having been found on the site, including <i>Sphagnum imbricatum</i> and <i>S. pulchrum</i>. Other species, such as the liverwort <i>Pleurozia purpurea</i> and brown beak-sedge <i>Rhynchospora fusca</i>, reflect the strong oceanic influence on the site. Transitions to saltmarsh are a notable feature of Kentra Moss.    </div>

Drumochter has been selected for its extensive areas of <b>blanket bog</b> which lie not only midway between the oceanic blanket bogs of the west and the drier, more continental bogs of the eastern Grampians, but also midway along the north–south transition. The kinds of bogs represented and their surface patterns reflect this intermediate position. In the Pass of Drumochter there is the most easterly extensive occurrence of western M17 <i>Scirpus cespitosus</i> – <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> blanket mire with typical species such as deergrass <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i>, purple moor-grass <i>Molinia caerulea</i>, cross-leaved heath <i>Erica tetralix</i> and bog asphodel <i>Narthecium ossifragum</i>.

    </b>
    <div>
Pettigoe is the only extensive lowland area of <b>blanket bog</b> in Northern Ireland. The site contains a large number of well-developed pool complexes, frequent acid flushes and basin mires. The vegetation is a mixture of generally <i>Sphagnum</i>-rich mire with cross-leaved heath <i>Erica tetralix</i> and <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i>, with extensive areas in which deergrass <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i> and hare’s-tail cottongrass <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> are dominant. A notable floristic feature is the abundance of purple moor-grass <i>Molinia caerulea</i> and black bog-rush <i>Schoenus nigricans</i> on the bog plain, a characteristic feature of hyper-oceanic lowland <b>Blanket bogs</b>. The rare bog-mosses <i>Sphagnum fuscum</i>, <i>S. imbricatum</i> and <i>S. pulchrum</i> occur on the site. Species such as intermediate bladderwort <i>Utricularia intermedia</i> and oblong-leaved sundew <i>Drosera intermedia</i> are abundant here but are generally absent from other <b>Blanket bogs</b> in Northern Ireland.    </div>

        Eastern Scotland, Highlands and Islands
    </b>
    <div>
Rannoch Moor lies in a high-level basin at about 300 m altitude. Its central location in Scotland is reflected in the gradient of variation in vegetation types that occurs across it. In the west of the site the vegetation has a high proportion of purple moor-grass <i>Molinia caerulea</i>, but further east this decreases while the proportion of woody dwarf-shrubs rises. Rannoch is a complex <b>Blanket bog</b> because much of the active peat is broken up between rocky knolls and small valleys, and there are many small ladder fens, which separate the ombrotrophic units into relatively small compartments. This is the only site in Britain at which Rannoch-rush <i>Scheuchzeria palustris</i> is found.    </div>

        Highlands and Islands
    </b>
    <div>
North Roe represents a distinctive <b>blanket bog</b> type found only in the far north of Scotland, where there is a sub-arctic oceanic climate. The bog type is characterised by large peat mounds, and all stages of mound development can be seen at this site, ranging from early formation, to domes of several metres high, through to collapsed examples and finally crater-pool formations.    </div>

        Northern Ireland
    </b>
    <div>
Slieve Beagh is one of the most extensive areas of intact <b>blanket bog</b> in Northern Ireland. It contains a comparatively large area of a mixture of generally <i>Sphagnum</i>-rich mire vegetation with cross-leaved heath <i>Erica tetralix</i> and <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i>, together with deergrass <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i> and hare’s-tail cottongrass <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> with high dwarf-shrub cover. It is less markedly oceanic than other Northern Ireland sites but has some limited areas of surface patterning    </div>

        Highlands and Islands
    </b>
    <div>
Sligachan is one of two sites on Skye representing two unusual and distinct mire types. Sligachan displays an enormous variety of <b>blanket bog</b> features. The southern half of the site consists of a series of valleyside flows interspersed with flushed blanket mire communities. The high base-status of the water means that the blanket bog vegetation of this southern part is extremely rich, containing species such as black bog-rush <i>Schoenus nigricans</i> and broad-leaved cottongrass <i>Eriophorum latifolium</i> and brown mosses such as <i>Drepanocladus</i> spp. The northern part of the site is a broad valley forming a mire complex with extensive areas of pool patterning of a linear type. Slightly more broken ground is largely infilled with accumulated peat and has several unusual peat structures, such as dams of peat over 2 m high that hold back large pools containing pipewort <i>Eriocaulon aquaticum</i>, small examples of ladder fens and oddly-shaped pool patterns.    </div>

        Cheshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, Greater Manchester, Lancashire, North Yorkshire, Shropshire and Staffordshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire
    </b>
    <div>
This site represents <b>blanket bog</b> in the south Pennines, the most south-easterly occurrence of the habitat in Europe. The bog vegetation communities are botanically poor. Hare’s-tail cottongrass <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> is often overwhelmingly dominant and the usual bog-building <i>Sphagnum</i> mosses are scarce. Where the blanket peats are slightly drier, heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, crowberry <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> and bilberry <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> become more prominent. The uncommon cloudberry <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i> is locally abundant in bog vegetation. Bog pools provide diversity and are often characterised by common cottongrass <i>E. angustifolium</i>. Substantial areas of the bog surface are eroding, and there are extensive areas of bare peat. In some areas erosion may be a natural process reflecting the great age (9000 years) of the south Pennine peats.    </div>

        <a href=/site/UK0014739 class="space-right">Strathglass Complex</a>
        Highlands and Islands
    </b>
    <div>
Strathglass Complex encompasses much of the east–west gradient that occurs in <b>blanket bog</b> north of the Great Glen. Both wet, oceanic M17 <i>Scirpus cespitosus</i> – <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> blanket mire and the drier, more upland M19 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> blanket mire occur extensively. Bog vegetation is at its most extensive on the lower slopes of these high hills, extending up glacial troughs and in to high corries and on to ridges. The blanket bog grades into a diversity of heathlands and grasslands on the better-drained upper slopes. The wetter M17 blanket mire forms part of typical west Highland complexes of bog, wet heath and dry heath but, unusually, also occurs within <b>91C0 Caledonian forest</b>. At high altitudes <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> in M19 is replaced by other dwarf-shrubs such as crowberry <i>Vaccinium vitis-idaea</i>, cowberry <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> ssp. <i>hermaphroditum</i> and bog bilberry <i>Vaccinium uliginosum</i>. Notably, these include the scarce dwarf birch <i>Betula nana</i> and alpine bearberry <i>Arctostaphylos alpinus</i> at one of their few known locations in blanket bog outside Ben Wyvis.    </div>

    <div>
Teal Lough is comparatively small but contains an exceptionally well-developed microtopography with the most extensive pool system found in Northern Ireland. The habitat is similar to Hebridean <b>Blanket bogs</b> with abundant lesser bladderwort <i>Utricularia minor</i> and oblong-leaved sundew <i>Drosera intermedia</i>. The rare hummock-forming bog-mosses <i>Sphagnum fuscum</i> and <i>S. imbricatum</i> also occur on the site.    </div>

Tingon demonstrates diversity of its surface patterning, erosion and other mire features, which cover a substantial tract of ground on the Tingon peninsula. Peat mounds are also a feature of the site. The vegetation is dominated by cottongrasses <i>Eriophorum</i> spp., heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, deergrass <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i>, cross-leaved heath <i>Erica tetralix</i> and bog-mosses <i>Sphagnum</i> spp.    </div>
