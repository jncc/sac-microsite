            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p><B>
<P>Sub-Arctic <I>Salix </I>spp. scrub</B> is the UK’s highest-altitude shrubby vegetation, occurring on moist, relatively base-rich soils in rocky situations on mountains. It is predominantly a natural habitat, with succession prevented by the harsh climate at the high altitudes at which it is found. It tends to be associated with the more sheltered areas of the upper subalpine and low alpine zones of mountains, and there may be a positive association with moderately late snow-lie. Stands of <I>Salix</I> scrub survive on ungrazed ledges and, more rarely, on lightly grazed, steep rocky slopes or boulder fields, occurring only as small, discrete stands or more scattered bushes. Grazing is believed to have reduced and restricted its occurrence. At many sites its continued future is precarious, since it is confined to often unstable rock ledges and reproducing populations are very small, isolated, and of uncertain long-term viability. The largest continuous stand of this very local habitat type is about 0.5&nbsp;ha in extent and most stands are very much smaller.</P>
<P>The Annex&nbsp;I habitat type consists of a mixture of willow species which have arctic-alpine and arctic-subarctic distributions in Europe. Sub-Arctic species include downy willow <I>Salix lapponum</I>, whortle-leaved willow <I>S.&nbsp;myrsinites</I>, mountain willow <I>S.&nbsp;arbuscula </I>and woolly willow <I>S.&nbsp;lanata</I>. Associated arctic-alpine and northern willows include net-leaved willow <I>S.&nbsp;reticulata</I>, dark-leaved willow <I>S.&nbsp;myrsinifolia </I>and tea-leaved willow <I>S.&nbsp;phylicifolia</I>. The willows grow among a rich mixture of dwarf shrubs, grasses, rushes and broad-leaved herbs, such as bilberry <I>Vaccinium myrtillus</I>, tufted hair-grass <I>Deschampsia cespitosa</I>, great wood-rush <I>Luzula sylvatica</I> and Alpine lady’s-mantle <I>Alchemilla alpina</I>, and the habitat supports many rare plants and animals of northern latitudes and high mountains. On the rock ledges <B>Sub-Arctic <I>Salix</I> spp. scrub</B> commonly mixes and associates with stands of <B>6430 Hydrophilous tall herb fringe communities of plains and of the montane to alpine levels</B>. </P>
<P>Several willow species may be found on the same site, but the most abundant willow varies from patch to patch of the habitat both within and between sites. Some of this variation may be related to the base-richness of the underlying substrate, the altitude of the stands or, more locally, the effects of grazing. The habitat usually occurs on soils developed on schist, which vary from strongly to weakly calcareous, and also on limestone. Different species of willow demand greater or lesser amounts of lime in the rocks. <I>S.&nbsp;lapponum</I> is relatively undemanding and can grow on lime-poor schist. It is therefore the most widespread species because lime-poor rocks are widely distributed. <I>S.&nbsp;lanata</I>, <I>S.&nbsp;myrsinifolia </I>and <I>S.&nbsp;reticulata</I> are more lime-demanding and are rare because suitable lime-rich rocks are localised. <I>S.&nbsp;arbuscula </I>is more resistant to grazing than other willow species and is found very locally on slopes open to grazing. <I>S.&nbsp;lanata</I>, the rarest willow species, forms patches where there is marked base-rich flushing. <I>S.&nbsp;reticulata</I> is a very low growing shrub which rarely forms scrub and is found more frequently in <B>6170 Alpine and subalpine calcareous grasslands</B>. <I>S.&nbsp;myrsinifolia </I>and <I>S.&nbsp;phylicifolia</I> occur only at the lower end of the altitudinal range of the habitat.</P>
<P>In the UK this vegetation corresponds partly to NVC type W20&nbsp;<I>Salix lapponum – Luzula sylvatica</I> scrub, but other types of willow scrub also fall within the definition of the Annex&nbsp;I type. <I>S.&nbsp;lapponum</I> is not necessarily the most frequent or abundant willow species in all stands of <I>Salix – Luzula </I>scrub, and other species such as <I>S.&nbsp;lanata</I> and <I>S.&nbsp;myrsinites</I> may be abundant. <I>S.&nbsp;myrsinites</I> scrub on limestone (a community which is not described in the NVC) is also included in this habitat. Stands of dominant <I>S.&nbsp;lapponum</I>, <I>S.&nbsp;myrsinites</I>, <I>S.&nbsp;lanata</I> and <I>S.&nbsp;arbuscula</I> are all included in the habitat.</P>
<P>The constituent willows of <B>Sub-Arctic <I>Salix </I>spp. scrub</B> also occur occasionally in a range of other habitats, including several Annex&nbsp;I types. On slopes open to light grazing, <B>Sub-Arctic <I>Salix </I>spp.</B> <B>scrub</B> gives way to <B>6170 Alpine and subalpine calcareous grasslands</B>, <B>6230 Species-rich <I>Nardus</I> grasslands, on siliceous substrates in mountain areas (and submountain areas in continental Europe)</B> and <B>4060 Alpine and Boreal heaths</B>. </P></p>

    <h2>European status and distribution</h2>
    <p><B>
<P>Sub-Arctic <I>Salix </I>spp. scrub</B> is a rare habitat, restricted in the Atlantic Biogeographical Region to mountains in the UK, Sweden and Finland. In Scandinavia <B>Sub-Arctic <I>Salix</I> spp. scrub</B> merges with tree-line birch woodland at high altitudes and high latitudes. Similar types of willow scrub occur more rarely in the mountain ranges of central and southern Europe, but these lack the Arctic willow species such as <I>Salix lanata</I>.</P></p>

<div class="section">
    <h2>UK status and distribution</h2>
    <p><B>
<P>Sub-Arctic <I>Salix </I>spp. scrub</B> is one of the UK’s most rare and endangered habitats, and is almost confined to the higher mountains of the Scottish Highlands where it is a relict of post-glacial vegetation. Fragmentary stands of the habitat occur in the Southern Uplands of Scotland and in Cumbria.</P></p>

Ben Lawers is one of four sites selected in the Breadalbane Hills of the southern Highlands and represents <b>Sub-Arctic <i>Salix</i> spp. scrub</b> with mountain willow <i>Salix arbuscula</i>. The site has the largest known population of <i>S. arbuscula</i> in the UK, developed on steep, rocky slopes and crags that are difficult for grazing animals to reach. It also occurs on some open grazed areas where it is highly prostrate. Ben Lawers also supports fragmentary stands of W20 <i>Salix lapponum</i> – <i>Luzula sylvatica</i> scrub on calcareous schist at moderately high altitudes. Other willows are restricted to crags and rock ledges. Species include downy willow <i>S. lapponum</i>, dark-leaved willow <i>S. myrsinifolia</i> and net-leaved willow <i>S. reticulata</i>, together with scattered plants of woolly willow <i>S. lanata</i>. Generally the <i>Salix</i> scrub is associated with <b>6430 Hydrophilous tall herb fringe communities of plains and of the montane to alpine levels</b> or <b>6170 Alpine and subalpine calcareous grasslands</b>.    </div>

Ben Lui supports W20 <i>Salix lapponum</i> – <i>Luzula sylvatica</i> scrub, occurring on highly calcareous schist at moderate altitude. The scrub is well-developed on an extensive series of schistose crags and rock ledges. Unlike at most other sites, the dominant species is whortle-leaved willow <i>Salix myrsinites</i>. This variant also occurs at Inchnadamph (where by contrast the scrub occurs at low altitude on limestone). Net-leaved willow <i>S. reticulata</i> is frequent, mainly associated with areas of calcareous grassland. Mountain willow <i>S. arbuscula</i>, tea-leaved willow <i>S. phylicifolia</i> and downy willow <i>S. lapponum</i> are also represented.

Drumochter Hills is representative of W20 <i>Salix lapponum</i> – <i>Luzula sylvatica</i> <b>Sub-Arctic <i>Salix</i> spp. scrub</b> on less calcareous schist in the east-central Highlands at moderately high altitude (750 m).

The habitat occurs in a variety of locations, including rock ledges, crags, by rocky burn-sides and, unusually, in wet scree on steep slopes. Exceptionally, in one place the scrub occurs with subalpine scrub of rowan <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i> and downy birch <i>Betula pubescens</i>.
