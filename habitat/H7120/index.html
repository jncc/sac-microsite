            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p><B>
<P>Degraded raised bogs</B> occur where there has been widespread disruption, usually by man, to the structure and function of the peat body. This can involve changes to the hydrology, vegetation, and physical structure of the bog, leading to desiccation, oxidation and loss of species or changes in the balance of the species composition. In contrast to <B>7110 Active raised bogs</B>, peat is not currently forming in <B>degraded bog</B>. The vegetation of degraded bog contains several, but not all, of the species typical of <B>Active raised bogs</B>, but the relative abundance and distribution of individual species differs.</P>
<P>The <A href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/nature/hab-en.htm"><I>Interpretation manual of European habitats</I></a> (European Commission DG Environment 1999) stresses that <B>Degraded raised bogs</B> only includes examples which are ‘capable of natural regeneration’, i.e. "where the hydrology can be repaired and where, with appropriate rehabilitation management, there is a reasonable expectation of re-establishing vegetation with peat-forming capability within 30 years". This has been assessed on a case-by-case basis. Provided they are capable of natural regeneration, the following land-cover types are considered to fall within the definition of <B>Degraded raised bogs</B>:</P>
<OL type=i>
<LI>Conifer plantations;</LI>
<LI>Improved pasture;</LI>
<LI>Scrub woodland (usually birch <I>Betula</I> spp.);</LI>
<LI>Bare peat;</LI>
<LI>Impoverished vegetation dominated by species including purple moor grass <I>Molinia caerulea</I>, hare’s-tail cottongrass <I>Eriophorum vaginatum</I> and heather <I>Calluna vulgaris</I>, and lacking significant cover of bog-mosses <I>Sphagnum</I> species</LI></OL></p>

    <h2>UK status and distribution</h2>
    <p><B>
<P>Degraded raised bogs</B> occur throughout the range of raised bogs in the UK. Obtaining an estimate of the national extent of this type is constrained by the lack of correspondence between Annex I habitat types and the condition categories used in the Lowland Raised Bog Inventory (LRBI) (Lindsay &amp; Immirzi 1996), which does not include Northern Ireland. However, <B>degraded raised bogs</B> are certainly more extensive than <B>7110 Active raised bogs</B>. Peatland in Northern Ireland has been classified and mapped using air photographs (Cruickshank &amp; Tomlinson 1988). This identified 2,270 ha of intact lowland peatland and 20,042 ha of ‘cut-over’ peatland, but it is not possible to report separately on the area of ‘active’ or ‘degraded’ raised bog using this information source.</P></p>

Areas of <b>degraded raised bog</b> occur peripheral to <b>7110 active raised bog</b> at this extensive inland composite raised mire site. The vegetation cover is predominantly composed of species-poor rank swards of purple moor-grass <i>Molinia caerulea</i> developed over surfaces grossly modified by drainage and peat-cutting.

    <div>
This bog complex is within the tributary plains of the Duddon estuary in south Cumbria. The contiguity of the original peat domes has been severed by road construction and agricultural conversion. On some of the component bogs peat-cutting has left a drained surface which is now only partially <b>7110 active raised bog</b>. The <b>degraded raised bog</b> is mostly dominated by purple moor grass <i>Molinia caerulea</i>, although pockets of raised bog plants including bog-mosses <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. offer good prospects for regeneration provided the hydrology is repaired. Degraded bog also occurs around the edges of discrete domes of active bog due to deep regional drainage and agricultural use of the surrounding land. There is no present-day peat-extraction on this site.    </div>

    </b>
    <div>
Flanders consists of a cluster of separate bogs in the central belt of Scotland that are the remnants of one of the largest <b>7110 Active raised bog</b> complexes in Britain. A variety of mire conditions, including small areas of <b>degraded raised bog</b>, are present within the site boundary, which collectively form the functional peatland-hydrological unit. East Flanders Moss is the largest raised bog in the UK that is still in a predominantly near-natural state. Areas previously managed for commercial peat extraction and forestry are currently being restored, agricultural drains blocked and invasive scrub removed. Collymoon Moss previously formed part of a peatland continuum with East Flanders. Killorn Moss and Shirgarton Moss form small satellites to East Flanders Moss, having once almost certainly been connected to it by fen peat which has disappeared through agricultural use. These sites have a narrow fringe of woodland giving way to open mire communities, which, in both cases, support vigorous bog-moss <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. vegetation and typical features of raised bog; they are therefore seen as an integral part of the site.    </div>

Like Thorne Moors, Hatfield Moors is a remnant of the once-extensive bog and fen peatlands within the Humberhead Levels, and is still the second-largest area of extant lowland raised bog peat in England. Moraines of sand occur beneath the peat, the largest of which forms Lindholme Island, in the centre of the bog. Little, if any, original bog surface has survived the massive extraction of peat over the last few decades. Peat-cutting has now ceased, and the bog is being restored over its remaining minimum average depth of 0.5 m of peat. </P>
<P>Refugia of vegetation have survived as rather dry heathland and as birch <EM>Betula</EM> woodland. Plants include the dwarf shrubs <EM>Calluna vulgaris</EM>, <EM>Erica tetralix</EM>, <EM>Eriophorum angustifolium</EM>, <EM>E. vaginatum</EM>, <EM>Vaccinium oxycoccos</EM>, bog-rosemary <EM>Andromeda polifolia</EM>, bog-myrtle <EM>Myrica gale</EM>, and the bog-mosses <EM>Sphagnum cuspidatum</EM>, <EM>S. recurvum</EM>, <EM>S. papillosum</EM>, <EM>S. subnitens</EM> and <EM>S. tenellum</EM>.

        Cheshire, Greater Manchester
    </b>
    <div>
Mossland formerly covered a very large part of low-lying Greater Manchester, Merseyside and southern Lancashire, and provided a severe obstacle to industrial and agricultural expansion. While most has been converted to agriculture or lost to development, several examples have survived as <b>degraded raised bog</b>, such as Risley Moss, Astley & Bedford Mosses and Holcroft Moss on the Mersey floodplain. Their surfaces are now elevated above surrounding land due to shrinkage of the surrounding tilled land, and all except Holcroft Moss have been cut for peat at some time in the past. While past drainage has produced dominant purple moor grass <i>Molinia caerulea</i>, bracken <i>Pteridium aquilinum</i> and birch <i>Betula</i> spp. scrub or woodland, wetter pockets have enabled the peat-forming species to survive. Recent rehabilitation management on all three sites has caused these to spread.    </div>

Most peat on the west coast of Scotland is classified as <b>7130 Blanket bogs</b>. The small amount of raised bog present in this area has suffered significant human impact. Mòine Mhór is the largest area of raised bog in this part of Scotland and represents the hyper-oceanic zone within the raised bog SAC series. It has been subjected to a number of damaging management activities in the past, including extensive drainage, commercial and domestic peat extraction and some afforestation, but now shows strong evidence of regeneration.

Peatlands Park is a large lowland raised bog that has been extensively cut for turf in the past. It represents one of the largest areas of <b>degraded raised bog</b> in Northern Ireland. Regeneration is taking place over a large part of the site, with heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> and cross-leaved heath <i>Erica tetralix</i> together with a mixture of sedges including hare’s-tail cottongrass <i>E. vaginatum</i>, common cottongrass <i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i> and <i>Sphagnum</i> bog-mosses. The peatland flora includes bog-rosemary <i>Andromeda polifolia</i> at one of its few Northern Ireland sites. The peatland interest also incorporates an area of intact lowland raised bog at Mullenakill. Associated woodland interest includes <b>91A0 old sessile oak woods with <i>Ilex</i> and <i>Blechnum</i></b> and <b>91D0 Bog woodland</b>.    </div>

This is a complex of raised bogs on the northern shore of Morecambe Bay in north-west England.

Solway Mosses North has two main components, Longbridge Muir and Kirkconnel Flow. Longbridge Muir is an extensive raised bog and one of the few remaining unplanted examples in this area. The site contains a large area of active mire with good quality peat-forming vegetation. Extensive surface patterning is present. While the bulk of the site is <b>7110 Active raised bog</b>, Longbridge Muir includes areas which have been drained and planted but which form an integral part of the overall peat mass. Work is in progress to restore this area, supported by an EC LIFE project.Kirkconnel Flow is low-altitude estuarine moss, around one-third of which consists of <b>7110 Active raised bog</b>, but the majority of the site has been invaded by tree and scrub cover. Nevertheless, extensive areas of good quality active bog remain, and this will be enhanced by work currently in progress to restore the degraded component, also supported by EC LIFE funds.    </div>

    <div>
A largely intact raised bog of roughly rectangular shape, with an arm of mossland protruding westwards from the south-west corner. The peat spills over from the main basin forming blanket mire, and as such it is classified as an intermediate bog. Some peat-cutting has taken place in the south-east and south-west of the moss, lowering the surface by about 1.5 m, and it is here that the bog is degraded. This predominantly active bog is surrounded by rough pasture, and there may be up to 149 ha of archaic peatland surrounding the site on thin blanket peat.</P>
<P>The degraded areas tend to be dominated by purple moor-grass <EM>Molinia caerulea</EM> with common cottongrass <EM>Eriophorum angustifolium</EM> and the bog-moss <EM>Sphagnum cuspidatum</EM> colonising pools. In drier areas a bog heath community is present with moribund heather <EM>Calluna vulgaris</EM> dominating. Small areas of birch-dominated woodland or scrub are present around the margins of the site. Rush pasture is also present on the margins, with species such as the rushes <EM>Juncus effusus</EM>, <EM>J. conglomeratus</EM>, <EM>J. acutiflorus</EM>, <EM>J. squarrosus</EM> and <EM>M. caerulea</EM>.    </div>
