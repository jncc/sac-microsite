<h4>Description and ecological characteristics</h4>
<p><B>
<P>Degraded raised bogs</B> occur where there has been widespread disruption, usually by man, to the structure and function of the peat body. This can involve changes to the hydrology, vegetation, and physical structure of the bog, leading to desiccation, oxidation and loss of species or changes in the balance of the species composition. In contrast to <B>7110 Active raised bogs</B>, peat is not currently forming in <B>degraded bog</B>. The vegetation of degraded bog contains several, but not all, of the species typical of <B>Active raised bogs</B>, but the relative abundance and distribution of individual species differs.</P>
<P>The <A href=&quot;http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/nature/hab-en.htm&quot;><I>Interpretation manual of European habitats</I></A> (European Commission DG&nbsp;Environment 1999) stresses that <B>Degraded raised bogs</B> only includes examples which are ‘capable of natural regeneration’, i.e. &quot;where the hydrology can be repaired and where, with appropriate rehabilitation management, there is a reasonable expectation of re-establishing vegetation with peat-forming capability within 30 years&quot;. This has been assessed on a case-by-case basis. Provided they are capable of natural regeneration, the following land-cover types are considered to fall within the definition of <B>Degraded raised bogs</B>:</P>
<OL type=i>
<LI>Conifer plantations;</LI>
<LI>Improved pasture;</LI>
<LI>Scrub woodland (usually birch <I>Betula</I> spp.);</LI>
<LI>Bare peat;</LI>
<LI>Impoverished vegetation dominated by species including purple moor grass <I>Molinia caerulea</I>, hare’s-tail cottongrass <I>Eriophorum vaginatum</I> and heather <I>Calluna vulgaris</I>, and lacking significant cover of bog-mosses <I>Sphagnum</I> species</LI></OL></p>

<h4>European status and distribution</h4>
<p><B>
<P>Degraded raised bogs</B> are widely distributed in Europe, and are found in most EU Member States.</P></p>

<h4>UK status and distribution</h4> 
<p>Click <a href=/habitat/H7120/map>here</a> view UK distribution of this species</p>
<p><B>
<P>Degraded raised bogs</B> occur throughout the range of raised bogs in the UK. Obtaining an estimate of the national extent of this type is constrained by the lack of correspondence between Annex&nbsp;I habitat types and the condition categories used in the Lowland Raised Bog Inventory (LRBI) (Lindsay &amp; Immirzi 1996), which does not include Northern Ireland. However, <B>degraded raised bogs</B> are certainly more extensive than <B>7110 Active raised bogs</B>. Peatland in Northern Ireland has been classified and mapped using air photographs (Cruickshank &amp; Tomlinson 1988). This identified 2,270&nbsp;ha of intact lowland peatland and 20,042&nbsp;ha of ‘cut-over’ peatland, but it is not possible to report separately on the area of ‘active’ or ‘degraded’ raised bog using this information source.</P></p>

<div class="cell large-12 small-12" style="padding-bottom: 1.5em">This bog complex is within the tributary plains of the Duddon estuary in south Cumbria. The contiguity of the original peat domes has been severed by road construction and agricultural conversion. On some of the component bogs peat-cutting has left a drained surface which is now only partially <b>7110 active raised bog</b>. The <b>degraded raised bog</b> is mostly dominated by purple moor grass <i>Molinia caerulea</i>, although pockets of raised bog plants including bog-mosses <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. offer good prospects for regeneration provided the hydrology is repaired. Degraded bog also occurs around the edges of discrete domes of active bog due to deep regional drainage and agricultural use of the surrounding land.

<div class="row">
<div class="cell large-12 small-12" style="padding-bottom: 1.5em">Flanders consists of a cluster of separate bogs in the central belt of Scotland that are the remnants of one of the largest <b>7110 Active raised bog</b> complexes in Britain. A variety of mire conditions, including small areas of <b>degraded raised bog</b>, are present within the site boundary, which collectively form the functional peatland-hydrological unit. East Flanders Moss is the largest raised bog in the UK that is still in a predominantly near-natural state. Areas previously managed for commercial peat extraction and forestry are currently being restored, agricultural drains blocked and invasive scrub removed. Collymoon Moss previously formed part of a peatland continuum with East Flanders. Killorn Moss and Shirgarton Moss form small satellites to East Flanders Moss, having once almost certainly been connected to it by fen peat which has disappeared through agricultural use. These sites have a narrow fringe of woodland giving way to open mire communities, which, in both cases, support vigorous bog-moss <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. vegetation and typical features of raised bog; they are therefore seen as an integral part of the site.</div></div>

Moraines of sand occur beneath the peat, the largest of which forms Lindholme Island, in the centre of the bog. Little, if any, original bog surface has survived the massive extraction of peat over the last few decades. Peat-cutting has now ceased, and the bog is being restored over its remaining minimum average depth of 0.5 m of peat. </P>
<P>Refugia of vegetation have survived as rather dry heathland and as birch <EM>Betula</EM> woodland.

<div class="row">
<div class="cell large-12 small-12" style="padding-bottom: 1.5em">Mossland formerly covered a very large part of low-lying Greater Manchester, Merseyside and southern Lancashire, and provided a severe obstacle to industrial and agricultural expansion. While most has been converted to agriculture or lost to development, several examples have survived as <b>degraded raised bog</b>, such as Risley Moss, Astley & Bedford Mosses and Holcroft Moss on the Mersey floodplain. Their surfaces are now elevated above surrounding land due to shrinkage of the surrounding tilled land, and all except Holcroft Moss have been cut for peat at some time in the past. While past drainage has produced dominant purple moor grass <i>Molinia caerulea</i>, bracken <i>Pteridium aquilinum</i> and birch <i>Betula</i> spp. scrub or woodland, wetter pockets have enabled the peat-forming species to survive. Recent rehabilitation management on all three sites has caused these to spread.</div></div>

Extensive surface patterning is present. While the bulk of the site is <b>7110 Active raised bog</b>, Longbridge Muir includes areas which have been drained and planted but which form an integral part of the overall peat mass. Work is in progress to restore this area, supported by an EC LIFE project.Kirkconnel Flow is low-altitude estuarine moss, around one-third of which consists of <b>7110 Active raised bog</b>, but the majority of the site has been invaded by tree and scrub cover.
