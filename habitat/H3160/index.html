            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p>
<P>Dystrophic systems most often occur on <B>7130 Blanket bogs</B> and may include isolated seasonal pools, random collections of irregularly-shaped more-or-less permanent waters, and ordered linear or concentric arrays of pools and small lochs. Dystrophic pools may be also found on raised bogs situated mainly on plains and valley bottoms.</P>
<P>These water bodies are very acidic and poor in plant nutrients. Their water has a high humic acid content and is usually stained dark brown through exposure to peat. Most examples are small (less than 5&nbsp;ha in extent), shallow, and contain a limited range of flora and fauna. In northern Scotland (where they are known as ‘dubh lochans’) bog-mosses <I>Sphagnum</I> spp. typically dominate and lesser bladderwort <I>Utricularia minor</I> is often found. Some dystrophic lakes have developed a ‘schwingmoor’ where bog-mosses are found in association with cottongrass <I>Eriophorum angustifolium</I> and white water-lily <I>Nymphaea alba</I>. The pools are naturally species-poor and a littoral zone is often absent. Fringing vegetation is that characteristic of the habitat in which the pools occur. Several notable scarce dragonfly species are associated with dystrophic lakes and ponds. </P>
<P>NVC types M1&nbsp;<I>Sphagnum auriculatum</I> bog pool community and M2&nbsp;<I>Sphagnum cuspidatum/recurvum</I> bog pool community are excluded from the Annex&nbsp;I definition, while non-dystrophic examples may be referable to Annex&nbsp;I type <B>3130 Oligotrophic to mesotrophic standing waters with vegetation of the <I>Littorelletea uniflorae </I>and/or of the <I>Isoëto-Nanojuncetea</B></I>. </P></p>

        Highlands and Islands
    </b>
    <div>
This site represents <b>Natural dystrophic lakes and ponds</b> on <b>7130 Blanket bogs</b> in northern Scotland. The scale and diversity of the peatlands of Caithness and Sutherland make them unique in Europe. They are three times larger than any other peat mass in the UK. Dystrophic waters are especially common in the Peatlands. Compared to most other blanket bog systems, at this site waterbodies account for a high proportion of the bog surface. Dystrophic water bodies here range in size from pools to medium-sized lochans. Surface patterns and pool complexes occur in a variety of forms, reflecting different climatic and hydrological conditions within the site.    </div>

    <div>
Foinaven in the north-west Highlands of Scotland supports dystrophic lochs and lochans formed in upland bogs. The ponds are generally small (<1 ha), un-named waterbodies and are located on the blanket bogs formed over most of the flat gneiss terrain and on the terraces alongside the River Dionard. The lochs support an impoverished flora that typically includes bog-mosses <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. and bogbean <i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>.    </div>

Hoy provides an important representation of dystrophic lochs and pools on <b>7130 Blanket bogs</b> and heathlands. The dystrophic lochs and ponds range in size and substrate type from pool complexes to moderate-sized lochs with peat, sand or stone substrates. The waterbodies support a limited flora typical of the acidic, low-nutrient habitat that includes bulbous rush <i>Juncus bulbosus</i>.

    <div>
Inverpolly supports high-quality freshwater loch habitats including dystrophic standing waters. The lochs are part of small unproductive drainage systems which characterise this part of the north-west Highlands. The naturally dystrophic pools are small (usually <1 ha) un-named waters, which are highly acidic, of very low productivity, and are often characterised by the presence of bog-mosses <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. The small size of lochans in this category and their remote geographical location has protected them against significant disturbance.    </div>

The uplands of Pettigoe Plateau, which extend from County Fermanagh in Northern Ireland into County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland, are covered by an extensive area of undulating western <b>7130 Blanket bogs</b> and heathland with numerous wetlands. The site contains the largest series of bog pool complexes in Northern Ireland. These <b>natural dystrophic lakes and ponds</b> are all less than 0.5 ha in size, and tend to be steep-sided, with banks and bed formed by layers of deep peat.

    <div>
Slieve Beagh in Northern Ireland is an extensive area of undulating upland <b>7130 Blanket bogs</b> and heathland that extends into County Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland. Within Northern Ireland, the peatland complex contains a number of <b>natural dystrophic lakes and ponds</b> that range in size from 5.5 ha to less than 0.5 ha. The site contains the largest concentration of medium- to large-sized dystrophic lakes in Northern Ireland. The smaller lakes and ponds are steep-sided with banks and bed formed by layers of deep peat. The larger lakes have shallow, shelving shores and hard, stony beds. Although the base-poor waters are low in plant nutrients and tend to have a characteristically impoverished flora and fauna, some important communities are present on the site. The most common type is characterised by the aquatic mosses <i>Sphagnum cuspidatum</i>, <i>S. denticulatum</i>, <i>Drepanocladus</i> spp. and the liverwort <i>Jungermannia</i> sp. The floating and marginal vegetation tends to be sparse and restricted, and consists of a scattered swamp and acid poor-fen fringe. The lakes are also important for a range of upland invertebrates.    </div>

Sligachan Peatlands on the Island of Skye occupies parts of low-lying valleys near the head of Loch Sligachan and contains many standing waters of dystrophic character. The dystrophic pools and lochans sit in a complex terrain of slopes, ridges, knolls and hollows that support blanket bog and oceanic mires. The dystrophic waters vary in shape from rounded to linear lochans but are predominantly complex, interconnected systems. They support a typically impoverished plant flora which includes such species as bogbean <i>Menyanthes trifoliata</i>, bladderworts <i>Utricularia</i> spp. and bog-mosses <i>Sphagnum</i> spp. The lochans also support pipewort <i>Eriocaulon aquaticum</i>, often in abundant populations, and the site is thought to represent the British stronghold for this rare species.    </div>

    <div>
West Midlands Mosses contains three pools, one at Clarepool Moss and two at Abbots Moss, that are examples of <b>dystrophic lakes and ponds</b> in the lowlands of England and Wales, where this habitat type is rare. The lake at Clarepool Moss is unusual as a dystrophic type on account of its relatively base-rich character, which is reflected in the presence of a diverse fauna and flora. The two at Abbots Moss are more typical, base-poor examples. The dystrophic lakes and ponds at this site are associated with Schwingmoor development, a characteristic of this habitat type in the West Midlands. Schwingmoor is an advancing floating raft of bog-moss <i>Sphagnum</i>, often containing NVC type M3 <i>Eriophorum angustifolium</i> bog pool community, which grows from the edge of the pool and can completely cover over the pool; the site has also been selected for this Annex I feature (<b>7140 Transition mires and quaking bogs</b>).     </div>
