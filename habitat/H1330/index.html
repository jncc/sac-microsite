            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p><B>
<P>Atlantic salt meadows</B> develop when halophytic vegetation colonises soft intertidal sediments of mud and sand in areas protected from strong wave action. This vegetation forms the middle and upper reaches of saltmarshes, where tidal inundation still occurs but with decreasing frequency and duration. A wide range of community types is represented and the saltmarshes can cover large areas, especially where there has been little or no enclosure on the landward side. The vegetation varies with climate and the frequency and duration of tidal inundation. Grazing by domestic livestock is particularly significant in determining the structure and species composition of the habitat type and in determining its relative value for plants, for invertebrates and for wintering or breeding waterfowl. In the UK this Annex&nbsp;I type corresponds to the following NVC types: </P>
<UL>
<LI>SM10&nbsp; Transitional low-marsh vegetation</LI>
<LI>SM11&nbsp; <I>Aster tripolium</I> var. <I>discoideus</I> salt-marsh community</LI>
<LI>SM12&nbsp; Rayed <I>Aster tripolium</I> salt-marsh community</LI>
<LI>SM13&nbsp; <I>Puccinellia maritima</I> salt-marsh community</LI>
<LI>SM14&nbsp; <I>Halimione portulacoides</I> saltmarsh community</LI>
<LI>SM15&nbsp; <I>Juncus maritimus – Triglochin maritima</I> salt-marsh community</LI>
<LI>SM16&nbsp; <I>Festuca rubra</I> salt-marsh community (coastal examples only) </LI>
<LI>SM17&nbsp; <I>Artemisia maritima</I> salt-marsh community </LI>
<LI>SM18&nbsp; <I>Juncus maritimus</I> salt-marsh community </LI>
<LI>SM19&nbsp; <I>Blysmus rufus</I> salt-marsh community</LI>
<LI>SM20&nbsp; <I>Eleocharis uniglumis</I> salt-marsh community. </LI></UL>
<P>Inland stands of SM16&nbsp;are referable to Annex&nbsp;I type <B>H1340 Inland salt meadows</B>.</P>
<P>At the lower reaches of the saltmarsh the vegetation is often naturally species-poor and may form an open sward of common saltmarsh-grass <I>Puccinellia maritima</I>. Further up the marsh, the vegetation becomes herb-dominated and red fescue <I>Festuca rubra</I> becomes more important. The upper saltmarsh shows considerable variation, particularly where there are transitions to other habitats. Communities present may include tussocks of sea rush <I>Juncus maritimus</I> dominating a herb-rich vegetation, and saltpans supporting patches of species-poor vegetation dominated by saltmarsh flat-sedge <I>Blysmus rufus</I> (in the north) or slender spike-rush <I>Eleocharis uniglumis</I>. Grazed saltmarsh in northern Scotland may contain frequent turf fucoid <I>Fucus cottonii</I>.</P>
<P>There may be transitions from upper saltmarsh to a number of habitats, including sand dune, machair, coastal shingle, freshwater marshes and woodland. This part of the saltmarsh succession has been particularly vulnerable to destruction by enclosure, usually involving the erection of a sea bank to exclude sea water, and remaining areas are regarded as particularly important for biodiversity conservation. </P>
<P>There are marked regional variations in the <B>Atlantic salt meadow</B> communities of the UK. In east and south-east England low to mid-marsh communities predominate, owing to extensive enclosure of the upper marsh. In contrast, the salt meadows of north-west England and south-west Scotland are dominated by extensive areas of grazed upper marsh communities characterised by <I>Puccinellia maritima</I> and saltmarsh rush <I>Juncus gerardii</I>. Swamp communities are particularly common in the upper marsh in south-west England, while <I>Juncus maritimus</I> communities are characteristic of Welsh saltmarshes, and transitional common reed <I>Phragmites australis </I>communities are common in south-east Scotland. Some characteristic plant species of southern saltmarshes are absent from Scotland, while others such as sea-purslane <I>Atriplex portulacoides</I> have a restricted distribution in northern Britain. </P></p>

    </b>
    <div>
The Dee Estuary is representative of <B>H1330 Atlantic salt meadows</B> in the north-west of the UK. It forms the most extensive type of saltmarsh in the Dee, and since the 1980s it has probably displaced very large quantities of the non-native common cord-grass <I >Spartina anglica</I>. The high accretion rates found in the estuary are likely to favour further development of this type of vegetation. The saltmarsh is regularly inundated by the sea; characteristic salt-tolerant perennial flowering plant species include common saltmarsh-grass <I>Puccinellia maritima</I>, sea aster <I>Aster tripolium</I>, and sea arrowgrass <I>Triglochin maritima</I>. In a few areas there are unusual transitions to wet woodland habitats.    </div>

    <div>
Dornoch Firth and Morrich More is the most northerly site selected for <b>Atlantic salt meadows</b> and represents this habitat type in the northern part of its UK range. The site supports a wide variety of community types, with the characteristic zonation from pioneer to upper marsh vegetation. At Morrich More the saltmarshes lie adjacent to sand dunes and there are important transitions between these habitats.     </div>

    <div>
Although the saltmarshes in this area are generally eroding, extensive salt meadows remain and Essex Estuaries represents <b>Atlantic salt meadows</b> in south-east England, with floristic features typical of this part of the UK. Golden samphire <i>Inula crithmoides</i> is a characteristic species of these marshes, occurring both on the lower marsh and on the drift-line.

    <div>
The Fal and Helford is an example of saltmarsh vegetation in a ria (drowned river valley), a physiographic type restricted to south-west England and west Wales. There is a narrow saltmarsh zonation typical of rias, from pioneer to upper marsh, and transitions to woodland where the fringing trees overhang the tidal river, an unusual juxtaposition of vegetation in the UK.    </div>

    <div>
This site, which includes both the Braint and Cefni estuaries, forms a complex of saltmarsh and dune habitats lying either side of the dune systems at Newborough Warren. <b>Atlantic salt meadows</b> form the bulk of the saltmarsh vegetation, but much of it is far from typical. In the Braint estuary the vegetation is characterised by unusually large amounts of greater sea-spurrey <i>Spergularia media</i>, whilst in the Cefni estuary the more typical Atlantic salt meadow is subordinate to saltmarsh dominated by sea rush <i>Juncus maritimus</i>. In fact, this is one of the largest stands of <i>Juncus maritimus</i> saltmarsh in Britain, and has affinities with <b>1410 Mediterranean salt meadows</b> (<b><i>Juncetalia maritimi</i></b>), an Annex I vegetation type that is not now considered to occur in the UK.    </div>

        Cumbria, Extra-Regio, Lancashire
    </b>
    <div>
Morecambe Bay is characteristic of saltmarshes in north-west England, with large areas of closely grazed upper marsh. The mid-upper marsh vegetation is strongly dominated by the saltmarsh-grass/fescue <i>Puccinellia</i>/<i>Festuca</i> communities, of which over 1,000 ha occur here, and by smaller areas of saltmarsh rush <i>Juncus gerardii</i> community. NVC type SM18 <i>Juncus maritimus</i> community is also more strongly represented here than elsewhere in England. The plant species include both southern elements, such as lesser centaury <i>Centaurium pulchellum</i>, and northern elements, such as saltmarsh flat-sedge <i>Blysmus rufus</i> and few-flowered spike-rush <i>Eleocharis quinqueflora</i>.    </div>

        <a href=/site/UK0019804 class="space-right">North Uist Machair</a>
        Highlands and Islands
    </b>
    <div>
The saltmarshes of north-west Scotland are usually small, and differ considerably from other saltmarshes in Europe, notably in their morphology, the scarcity or absence of a pioneer zone and the prevalence of the turf fucoid <i>Fucus cottonii</i> in closely-grazed turf. North Uist Machair is one of the larger composite examples. Many species dominant on southern British saltings are completely absent, and much of the expanse comprises common saltmarsh-grass <i>Puccinellia maritima</i>, sea-milkwort <i>Glaux maritima</i>, plantain <i>Plantago</i> spp. and thrift <i>Armeria maritima</i>, with red fescue <i>Festuca rubra</i> and saltmarsh rush <i>Juncus gerardii</i> at higher levels. Transitions to terrestrial habitats tend to be richer in species, featuring silverweed <i>Potentilla anserina</i> and smooth meadow-grass <i>Poa pratensis</i> while transitions to fens have saltmarsh flat-sedge <i>Blysmus rufus</i> and sea arrowgrass <i>Triglochin maritimum</i>. Locally there are also fine transitions to dune and machair, making this one of the most varied of north-western saltmarshes.    </div>

    <div>
This site is representative of a ria system in south-west England. The well-developed salinity gradient supports <b>Atlantic salt meadow</b> together with natural transitions to brackish and freshwater communities, including reedbeds supporting the only UK population of triangular club-rush <i>Schoenoplectus triqueter</i>. Some stands of saltmeadow are structurally and botanically diverse and include sea club-rush <i>Scirpus maritimus</i> and saltmarsh rush <i>Juncus gerardii</i>, with red fescue <i>Festuca rubra</i>, sea rush <i>J. maritimus</i> and thrift <i>Armeria maritima</i> at higher levels. The locally common parsley water-dropwort <i>Oenanthe lachenalii</i> is also found in some parts of the site, and there are stands of sea-purslane <i>Halimione portulacoides</i>, which is unusual in Cornwall. The <b>Atlantic salt meadows</b> make a vital contribution to the structure and function of the estuary and the other habitats within it.    </div>

    <div>
The Solent contains the second-largest aggregation of <b>Atlantic salt meadows</b> in south and south-west England. Solent Maritime is a composite site composed of a large number of separate areas of saltmarsh. In contrast to the Severn estuary, the salt meadows at this site are notable as being representative of the ungrazed type and support a different range of communities dominated by sea-purslane <i>Atriplex portulacoides</i>, common sea-lavender <i>Limonium vulgare</i> and thrift <i>Armeria maritima</i>. As a whole the site is less truncated by man-made features than other parts of the south coast and shows rare and unusual transitions to freshwater reedswamp and alluvial woodland as well as coastal grassland. Typical <b>Atlantic salt meadow</b> is still widespread in this site, despite a long history of colonisation by cord-grass <i>Spartina</i> spp.    </div>

        Cumbria, Extra-Regio, South Western Scotland
    </b>
    <div>
The Solway Firth, between north-west England and south-west Scotland, has been little affected by enclosure, with the result that it demonstrates unusually large areas of upper marsh and transitions to freshwater grassland communities. There is a greater proportion of sand in the substrate than is found in more southern saltmarshes. The mid-upper marsh is heavily dominated by saltmarsh rush <i>Juncus gerardii</i> community with smaller areas of the saltmarsh-grass/fescue <i>Puccinellia</i>/<i>Festuca</i> communities. The site has been selected because of its large size and uninterrupted transitions. Some of the species present, for example sea-purslane <i>Atriplex portulacoides</i>, common sea-lavender <i>Limonium vulgare</i> and lax-flowered sea-lavender <i>Limonium humile</i>, are at their northern limit in the UK.    </div>

This site on the east coast of England is selected both for the extensive ungrazed saltmarshes of the North Norfolk Coast and for the contrasting, traditionally grazed saltmarshes around the Wash. The Wash saltmarshes represent the largest single area of the habitat type in the UK. The <b>Atlantic salt meadows</b> form part of a sequence of vegetation types that are unparalleled among coastal sites in the UK for their diversity and are amongst the most important in Europe. Saltmarsh swards dominated by sea-lavenders <i>Limonium</i> spp. are particularly well-represented on this site. In addition to typical lower and middle saltmarsh communities, in North Norfolk there are transitions from upper marsh to freshwater reedswamp, sand dunes, shingle beaches and mud/sandflats.    </div>
