            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p><B>
<P>Calaminarian grasslands</B> occur on soils that have levels of heavy metals, such as lead, zinc, chromium and copper, that are toxic to most plant species. The greatest extent of the habitat occurs on artificial sites associated with past mining activities. Near-natural examples are much more localised. There are three main situations where this habitat type has developed:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Near-natural, open vegetation of serpentine rock and mineral vein outcrops with skeletal soils;</LI>
<LI>Stable river gravels rich in lead and zinc and that are near-natural, although the heavy metal content may be partly an artefact of past mining activity in the river catchment;</LI>
<LI>Artificial mine workings and spoil heaps, mainly on limestone; these are numerous (several thousand UK localities) and extensive, although few sites have a high species-richness.</LI></OL>
<P>Grasslands of this type are referable to the <I>Thlaspion-Calaminariae</I> alliance. The vegetation is typically species-poor but contains a number of species principally found in this habitat, most notably spring sandwort <I>Minuartia verna</I> and alpine penny-cress <I>Thlaspi caerulescens</I>. There is a genetically-adapted range of other species, such as sheep’s fescue <I>Festuca ovina</I>, bladder campion <I>Silene vulgaris</I>,<I> </I>sea campion <I>Silene uniflora</I> and thrift <I>Armeria maritima</I>. Heavy metal toxicity of the soils, perhaps combined with a low nutrient status, is believed to maintain the open vegetation, retarding succession. The rarer species are favoured by lack of competition from more vigorous colonists. The Annex&nbsp;I type also includes assemblages of metal-tolerant lower plants on mine waste, even if higher plant metallophytes are lacking. </P>
<P>In the UK some forms of this vegetation correspond to NVC type OV37&nbsp;<I>Festuca ovina – Minuartia verna</I> community; other forms characterised by different metallophyte plant species or races and ecotypes are not described in the NVC. </P><B>
<P>Calaminarian grasslands</B> and associated rock outcrops provide a habitat for several scarce plants, including northern rock-cress <I>Arabis petraea</I>, forked spleenwort <I>Asplenium septentrionale</I> and Young’s helleborine <I>Epipactis youngiana</I>. In northern parts of the UK there are local populations of boreal species that characterise these habitat conditions in Scandinavia, such as arctic sandwort <I>Arenaria norvegica</I> ssp.<I> norvegica</I> and the endemic Shetland mouse-ear <I>Cerastium nigrescens</I>. Some sites hold important populations of rare bryophytes and lichens.</P></p>

Caenlochan in north-east Scotland represents natural, open <B>Calaminarian grasslands</B> over serpentine debris, occurring at about 850<FONT size=2>–</FONT>870&nbsp;m altitude on Meikle Kilrannoch, the highest representation of the habitat in the UK. The site is notable for the large population of the rare alpine catchfly <I>Lychnis alpina</I>, which occurs at only one other locality in the UK (the other station being in the English Lake District). Other characteristic plants of the debris include thrift <I>Armeria maritima</I>, mossy cyphel <I>Minuartia sedoides</I> and scurvygrass <I>Cochlearia</I> sp.

    <div>
Coyles of Muick represents the second-largest extent of near-natural, open serpentine debris with Calaminarian vegetation in Scotland. The habitat occurs at high altitude (450-600 m), exceeded in altitude only by Meikle Kilrannoch on Caenlochan. The serpentine here is more calcareous and less toxic than on other serpentine sites in north-east Scotland, perhaps favouring certain species that do not normally occur on serpentine. The Calaminarian community occurs in open serpentine debris on the summit and upper slopes, and is unusual in including alpine mouse-ear <i>Cerastium alpinum</i> (but not spring sandwort <i>Minuartia verna</i>). Other species include northern rock-cress <i>Arabis petraea</i>, mossy saxifrage <i>Saxifraga hypnoides</i>, yellow mountain saxifrage <i>S. aizoides</i>, thrift <i>Armeria maritima</i>, field gentian <i>Gentianella campestris</i> and sea campion <i>Silene uniflora</i>. There are transitions to grassland and fen habitats, and dry heath dominates the lower slopes of the site.    </div>

Heavy metals have been extracted from the Ystwyth Valley for over 1000 years. At Cwm Ystwyth this activity has left extensive areas of rock outcrop, scree, spoil-heaps and abandoned shafts, adits and buildings variously affected by heavy metals available for colonisation by heavy metal-tolerant plant species. Lichens and bryophytes are a notable component of the developing flora and include a number of scarce species such as <i>Vezdaea cobria</i>, <i>Lecanora handelii</i>, <i>Gyalidea subscutellaris</i> and <i>Ditrichum plumbicola</i>.    </div>

    <div>
Gang Mine is an example of <b>Calaminarian grasslands</b> in an anthropogenic context in northern England. Natural limestone outcrops supporting species typical of calaminarian grasslands are rare and small, with a very impoverished flora. This site is included to provide an example of the habitat type on sedimentary rocks; it has colonised the large area of mine workings and spoil heaps on limestone. These are notable for the wide variations in slope, aspect and soil toxicity. Floristically the site contains the richest anthropogenic Calaminarian grasslands in the UK, with abundant spring sandwort <i>Minuartia verna</i> and alpine penny-cress <i>Thlaspi caerulescens</i>. Other species of grassland vegetation present include early-purple orchid <i>Orchis mascula</i> and dyer’s greenweed <i>Genista tinctoria</i>. Many of these species are likely to be distinct genotypes adapted to soils rich in heavy metals.    </div>

At Gro Ystwyth, waste from past heavy metal mining has combined with natural river gravel to create the foundations of an extensive area of shingle heath on the flood plain of the River Ystwyth below Grogwynion. As the river reworks the gravel in a series of braided channels fresh material is deposited, and a range of seral stages in the development of heath and scrub are found at this site.Lichens are locally dominant in the heath, with a number of uncommon species present including <i>Cladonia fragilissima</i> and <i>C. uncialis</i> ssp. <i>uncialis</i>. Normally montane species, such as <i>Stereocaulon condensatum</i> and <i>Epilichen scabrosus</i>, occur here at an unusually low altitude. Metallophyte lichens of open ground are well-represented, with nationally scarce species, such as <i>Vezdaea acicularis</i>, <i>Gyalidea subscutellaris</i> and <i>Thelocarpon impressellum</i>, occurring amongst patches of sea campion <i>Silene uniflora</i>.    </div>

Halkyn Mountain has the most extensive recorded area of the metalliferous NVC type OV37 <I>Festuca ovina</I> – <I>Minuartia verna</I> grassland community in Wales. Stands of this vegetation type are associated with a number of old lead and zinc ore mines, which date back to Roman times and were intensively worked during the 19<SUP>th</SUP> century. They include relatively open, lichen-rich swards, as well as more closed examples with abundant wild thyme <I>Thymus polytrichus</I>. The stands are scattered over an extensive undulating plateau of Carboniferous limestone, most of which is unenclosed common land. They are associated with more extensive areas of open and closed calcareous and acidic grassland and dwarf shrub heath vegetation vegetation, some of which is upland in character.    </div>

This site on the south-eastern edge of Bodmin Moor supports internationally-important <b>Calaminarian grassland</b> metallophyte communities. The legacy of a long history of copper and tin extraction survives as mine spoil which has been colonised by a number of metallophytic bryophytes. In particular, the site supports the only known site in the world for the endangered Cornish path-moss <i>Ditrichum cornubicum</i>. Other notable metallophytes include the Red Data Book liverworts <i>Cephaloziella massalongi</i> and the endemic <i>C. nicholsonii</i>, both associated with copper-rich substrates, and the mosses <i>Pohlia andalusica</i> and <i>Scopelophila cataractae</i>, the latter possibly an introduction into this country on imported ore. Many other notable bryophytes have colonised the spoil, including the liverworts <i>Cephaloziella integerrima</i>, <i>C. stellulifera</i>, <i>Lophozia sudetica</i>, <i>Gymnomitrion obtusum</i> and <i>Marsupella funckii</i>, and the moss <i>Ditrichum lineare</i>.

The river gravels contain a range of structural types, ranging from a highly toxic, sparsely vegetated area with abundant lichens through to closed willow/alder <i>Salix</i>/<i>Alnus</i> woodland. In addition, the site is of considerable functional interest for the series of fossilised river channel features. Spring sandwort <i>Minuartia verna</i> and thrift <i>Armeria maritima</i> are particularly abundant, and there are several rare species, including Young’s helleborine <i>Epipactis youngiana</i>, which has its main UK population at this site. The site is also of great importance for its lichen communities. A number of rare and scarce species are present, including the Red Data Book-listed <i>Peltigera venosa</i>.    </div>

At this site in the north-west Pennines, <b>Calaminarian grassland</b> occurs in association with lead mine waste and river shingles of the rivers South Tyne and Nent. This site supports a rich metallophyte flora with substantial populations of six species of higher plant metallophytes: thrift <i>Armeria maritima</i>, moonwort <i>Botrychium lunaria</i>, Pyrenean scurvygrass <i>Cochlearia pyrenaica</i>, spring sandwort <i>Minuartia verna</i>, alpine penny-cress <i>Thlaspi caerulescens</i> and mountain pansy <i>Viola lutea</i>. The site is also of great importance for its lichen communities associated with both spoil and river shingle. A number of rare and scarce species are present, including <i>Peltigera venosa</i>, <i>P. neckeri</i> and <i>Sarcosagium campestre</i> var. <i>macrosporum</i>. The site shows the full succession from open sparsely vegetated shingle and spoil to closed turf. Transitions from Calaminarian grassland to both calcareous grassland and dry heath also occur.    </div>
