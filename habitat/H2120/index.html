            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p><B>
<P>Shifting dunes along the shoreline with <I>Ammophila arenaria </I>(&quot;white dunes&quot;)</B> encompasses most of the vegetation of unstable dunes where there is active sand movement. Under these conditions sand-binding marram <I>Ammophila arenaria</I> is always a prominent feature of the vegetation and is usually dominant. In the UK the majority of such vegetation falls within NVC type SD6&nbsp;<I>Ammophila arenaria</I> mobile dune community. This is a dynamic vegetation type maintained only by change. It can occur on both accreting and eroding dunes, but will rapidly change and disappear if stability is imposed. It rarely occurs in isolation because of its dynamic nature and because it is successionally related to other dune habitats. The habitat type excludes the low, embryonic dunes where occasional exposure to saltwater flooding constrains the growth of marram and where plants of the strandline mingle with salt-tolerant, sand-binding grasses; such vegetation is referable to Annex&nbsp;I type <B>2110 Embryonic shifting dunes</B>.</P>
<P>The species composition of shifting dunes is constrained by the harsh conditions, but the vegetation is by no means uniform. The most marked floristic variation relates to the degree of instability. Where sand accretion is extremely rapid it is possible to find vegetation that consists only of <I>A.&nbsp;arenaria</I>. As rates of sand deposition decline the marram is joined by more species, first by other specialised dune plants, then by less specialised grasses, drought-tolerant annuals and a restricted number of specialised bryophytes such as the moss <I>Tortula ruralis</I> ssp. <I>ruraliformis</I>. This moss plays an important part in completing the stabilisation of the sand surface. Towards the seaward edge of the zone of shifting dunes, salt-tolerant plants such as sea sandwort <I>Honckenya peploides</I> may be prominent, along with the sand-binding sand couch <I>Elytrigia juncea</I>. Further inland these species are rarely prominent. </P>
<P>There is also geographical variation in the floristic composition of the habitat type. A number of typical shifting dune plants such as Portland spurge <I>Euphorbia portlandica</I> and sea-holly <I>Eryngium maritimum</I> are mostly confined to the south of the UK, while lyme-grass <I>Leymus arenarius</I> is much more abundant in the northern half of Britain, where the vegetation may fall within the NVC type SD5&nbsp;<I>Leymus arenarius</I> mobile dune community. </P></p>

Carmarthen Bay Dunes is representative of mobile dunes in south Wales and contains a very large area of <b>shifting dunes along the shoreline</b>, covering approximately 80 ha in total. In parts of the system (e.g. at Whiteford Burrows) dunes are actively accreting and there are clear zonations of embryonic dunes, shifting dunes and semi-fixed dunes.

The dunes at Crossapol and Feall Bay have the greater part of the mobile dune on Coll, maintained not only by high exposure and good sand supply but by a number of significant blowouts including three very large cauldron blowouts, one of which rises to 35 m O.D. As is frequently the case in western Scotland, there is very little foredune, and the dune front is steep with slumped turfs. Marram <i>Ammophila arenaria</i> dominates the dunes to the extent of being the only species present in some areas, and having only scattered creeping thistle <i>Cirsium arvense</i> and sand couch <i>Elytrigia juncea</i>; lyme-grass <i>Leymus arenarius</i> is absent.    </div>

    <div>
This large dune system on the east coast of Scotland is physically diverse, with areas of active accretion, areas of marine erosion and areas of internal instability. There are well-formed parabolic dunes in one area. All of these formations provide opportunities for <b>Shifting dunes along the shoreline with <i>Ammophila arenaria</i></b> to develop. As a result this habitat type is relatively extensive within the site. The vegetation is representative of northern mobile dune vegetation, with lyme-grass <i>Leymus arenarius</i> prominent in some stands.

Studland Dunes represents <b>shifting dunes along the shoreline</b> in southern England. Shifting dunes form one part of the very well-marked successional sequences. The seaward dune ridge supports marram <i>Ammophila arenaria</i> vegetation mainly of NVC type SD6e <i>Ammophila arenaria</i> mobile dune, <i>Festuca rubra</i> sub-community, though three other types are represented.

Torrs Warren – Luce Sands is a very large site in south-west Scotland, with examples of two types of shifting dune vegetation. The foredunes are morphologically less active than other sites in this part of the UK, with less sand accretion and erosion. Nevertheless, there is sufficient sand accretion to support a narrow band of <b>Shifting dunes along the shoreline with <i>Ammophila arenaria</i></b>, with associated species such as sand sedge <i>Carex arenaria</i> and red fescue <i>Festuca rubra</i>. In addition, shifting dune vegetation with marram is found on blow outs, where active sand movement is occurring in the semi-fixed dunes that form the landward part of the site.     </div>

<b>Shifting dune</b> vegetation forms a major component of the active sand dune systems at the entrance to Morecambe Bay on Walney Island and the Duddon Estuary at Sandscale Haws. A small area is also present at the entrance to the Wyre. Sandscale Haws supports a mosaic of shifting communities, which form a continuous block around the seaward edge of this site. There are transitions to <b>2110 Embryonic shifting dunes</b>. The prograding shingle spits at either end of Walney Island support dune systems at South End and North End Haws.

The dunes that cover part of Sands of Forvie form one of three sites on the east coast of Scotland selected to represent <b>Shifting dunes along the shoreline with <i>Ammophila arenaria</i></b>. They are exceptionally mobile, with large areas of bare sand, and there are extensive areas of this habitat type on the site. The site is particularly noted for the substantial areas where sand accretion is so rapid that only marram <i>Ammophila arenaria</i> can survive. However, other types of shifting dune vegetation can be seen, reflecting different degrees of instability. For example, in areas where there is less sand accretion, red fescue <i>Festuca rubra</i> may be found with the marram.     </div>

<b>Shifting dunes along the shoreline with <i>Ammophila arenaria</i></b> occurs along the seaward edge of the northern half of this extensive dune system.

    </b>
    <div>
A substantial stretch of the Sefton Coast dune system in north-west England is fronted by about 163 ha of <b>shifting dunes</b>. Marram <i>Ammophila arenaria</i> usually dominates the mobile dunes, amidst considerable areas of blown sand. Where rates of sand deposition decline, lyme grass <i>Leymus arenarius</i>, sea-holly <i>Eryngium maritimum</i> and cat’s-ear <i>Hypochaeris radicata</i> occur, with red fescue <i>Festuca rubra</i> and spreading meadow-grass <i>Poa humilis</i> present on the more sheltered ridges. Sea spurge <i>Euphorbia paralias</i> and the nationally scarce dune fescue <i>Vulpia fasciculata</i> are frequent, while sea bindweed <i>Calystegia soldanella</i> is very local. Formby Point is the hinge point between two coastal sub-cells. The zone around the Point has been eroding since 1906 while areas north and south of this zone are accreting (where the nature of the coast allows). The rapid erosion is therefore reducing the area of shifting dunes at Formby, and high, steep eroding dunes abut the beach with extensive areas of blown sand immediately inland.    </div>
