            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p><B>
<P>European dry heaths</B> typically occur on freely-draining, acidic to circumneutral soils with generally low nutrient content. Ericaceous dwarf-shrubs dominate the vegetation. The most common is heather <I>Calluna vulgaris</I>, which often occurs in combination with gorse <I>Ulex</I> spp., bilberry <I>Vaccinium</I> spp. or bell heather <I>Erica cinerea</I>, though other dwarf-shrubs are important locally. Nearly all dry heath is semi-natural, being derived from woodland through a long history of grazing and burning. Most dry heaths are managed as extensive grazing for livestock or, in upland areas, as grouse moors.</P>
<P>Twelve NVC types in Britain meet the definition of this habitat type: </P>
<UL>
<LI>H1  <I>Calluna vulgaris – Festuca ovina </I>heath</LI>
<LI>H2  <I>Calluna vulgaris – Ulex minor </I>heath</LI>
<LI>H3  <I>Ulex minor – Agrostis curtisii </I>heath</LI>
<LI>H4  <I>Ulex gallii – Agrostis curtisii </I>heath</LI>
<LI>H7  <I>Calluna vulgaris – Scilla verna</I> heath</LI>
<LI>H8  <I>Calluna vulgaris – Ulex gallii</I> heath</LI>
<LI>H9  <I>Calluna vulgaris – Deschampsia flexuosa </I>heath</LI>
<LI>H10  <I>Calluna vulgaris – Erica cinerea</I> heath</LI>
<LI>H12  <I>Calluna vulgaris – Vaccinium myrtillus </I>heath</LI>
<LI>H16  <I>Calluna vulgaris – Arctostaphylos uva-ursi </I>heath</LI>
<LI>H18  <I>Vaccinium myrtillus – Deschampsia flexuosa </I>heath</LI>
<LI>H21  <I>Calluna vulgaris – Vaccinium myrtillus – Sphagnum capillifolium </I>heath</LI></UL>
<P>Not all forms of these communities are <B>European dry heaths</B>. For example, dry heath vegetation on deep peat is regarded as bog, while alpine forms of the last five types listed above (found at high elevations and in northern latitudes around and above the presumed natural tree-line) are referable to Annex I type <B>4060 Alpine and Boreal heaths</B>. Most forms of H1 <I>Calluna – Festuca </I>heath belong within the <B>European dry heaths </B>category, including those rare occurences of the <I>Carex arenaria</I> sub-community (H1d) on inland dune systems such as Breckland; but this sub-community is more usually found on the coast, when is referable to <B>2150 Atlantic decalcified fixed dunes</B>. Stands of H7 <I>Calluna – Scilla </I>heath on moorland near the sea conform to <B>European dry heaths</B>, but most examples, together with stands of H8d <I>Calluna – Ulex </I>heath,<I> Scilla verna</I> sub-community on sea cliffs, are referable to <B>1230 Vegetated sea cliffs of the Atlantic and Baltic coasts</B>. Dry heaths vary in their flora and fauna according to climate, and are also influenced by altitude, aspect, soil conditions (especially base-status and drainage), maritime influence, and grazing and burning intensity. There is a gradation from southerly to northerly kinds of dry heath, and there are also both western (oceanic) and eastern (more continental) forms.</P>
<P>On slightly damp soils in the mild, oceanic climate of south-west England and south Wales, there is the uncommon H4 <I>Ulex– Agrostis</I> heath, characterised by the frequency of bristle bent <I>Agrostis curtisii </I>and western gorse <I>Ulex gallii</I>, alongside <I>Calluna</I>, bell heather <I>Erica cinerea</I> and cross-leaved heath <I>E. tetralix</I>. The rare Dorset heath <I>E. ciliaris</I> and Cornish heath <I>E. vagans</I> are found locally in this community. On similarly moist soils further east, in Dorset and the New Forest, <I>U. gallii</I> is replaced by dwarf gorse <I>U. minor</I> in H3 <I>Ulex – Agrostis </I>heath. H2 <I>Calluna – Ulex</I> heath occurs on dry acid soils in the lowlands of south-east and central southern England, and is typically dominated by mixtures of <I>Calluna</I>, <I>U. minor</I> and <I>E. cinerea</I>. The semi-continental H1 <I>Calluna – Festuca </I>heaths of Breckland on the western Norfolk-Suffolk border are generally overwhelmingly dominated by <I>Calluna</I>, with, sometimes, an abundance of lichens. Lowland heaths in southern Britain often support an important fauna, including birds (such as European nightjar <I>Caprimulgus europaeus</I> and Dartford warbler <I>Sylvia undata</I>), reptiles (such as sand lizard <I>Lacerta agilis</I> and smooth snake <I>Coronella austriaca</I>) and invertebrates.</P>
<P>At low to moderate altitudes in warm oceanic parts of southern Britain, the typical form of the habitat is H8 <I>Calluna – Ulex</I> heath, characterised by abundant <I>Calluna</I>, <I>U. gallii</I> and <I>E. cinerea</I>. <I>U. gallii</I> becomes scarce in the cooler oceanic climate further north, where <I>E. cinerea</I> and <I>Calluna</I> are abundant together in H10 <I>Calluna – Erica</I> heath, especially on more southerly-facing slopes; <I>E. cinerea</I> becomes dominant in the hyper-oceanic fringes of the north-west. On more sheltered, humid slopes there are H21 <I>Calluna – Vaccinium – Sphagnum </I>heaths with a high cover of bog-mosses <I>Sphagnum</I> spp. and hypnaceous mosses, which are best-developed in Scotland. In the hyper-oceanic far north-west Highlands and Islands these heaths are rich in Atlantic bryophytes, and especially liverworts such as <I>Bazzania tricrenata</I>, <I>Herbertus aduncus</I> ssp. <I>hutchinsiae</I>, <I>Mastigophora woodsii</I> and <I>Pleurozia purpurea</I>, which develop as luxuriant mats under the canopy of dwarf-shrubs. The UK is one of the most important parts of the world for Atlantic bryophytes, and this is the most important habitat for many of these oceanic species of restricted world distribution.</P>
<P>At low to moderate elevations in the less oceanic areas of north-east England and the Midlands there are often extensive species-poor heaths (H9 <I>Calluna</I> <I>– Deschampsia</I> heaths) with an overwhelming dominance of <I>Calluna</I> and frequent wavy hair-grass <I>Deschampsia flexuosa</I>. These are often the least diverse of all UK heaths. In upland regions further north, there are sub-montane <I>Calluna</I>-dominated heaths with abundant bilberry <I>Vaccinium myrtillus</I> and crowberry <I>Empetrum nigrum</I> ssp. <I>nigrum</I> (H12 <I>Calluna – Vaccinium</I>), and, in the eastern Scottish Highlands, bearberry <I>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi </I>(H16 <I>Calluna – Arctostaphylos</I>). <I>Calluna – Vaccinium </I>heaths occur throughout the British uplands, but are best-developed in the North Pennines and north-eastern Scotland. They often hold important populations of moorland birds. Red grouse<I> Lagopus lagopus scoticus</I>, hen harrier <I>Circus cyaneus</I>, merlin <I>Falco columbarius</I>, twite <I>Carduelis flavirostris</I>, short-eared owl <I>Asio flammeus</I> and golden plover <I>Pluvialis apricaria</I> occur widely. Black grouse <I>Lyrurus tetrix</I> and golden eagle <I>Aquila chrysaetes</I> are especially associated with the Scottish Highlands, and whimbrel <I>Numenius phaeopus</I> and great skua <I>Stercorarius skua</I> with the northern maritime moors of Scotland. Increasing snow-lie at high altitude favours bilberry species in particular, and H18 <I>Vaccinium – Deschampsia</I> heaths are abundant in the central and eastern Scottish Highlands; the rare blue heath <I>Phyllodoce caerulea</I> occurs very locally in these snow-bed heaths which grade to <B>4060 Alpine and Boreal heaths</B>. <I>Vaccinium</I>-dominated heaths also occur in more southerly upland areas where <I>Calluna</I> heaths have been subjected to heavy grazing and/or inappropriate burning.</P>
<P>Species-rich forms of dry heath (so-called chalk heath and limestone heath) occur where acid surface deposits overlie calcareous materials. Such heaths contain unusual combinations of heath and calcareous grassland species, such as common rock-rose <I>Helianthemum nummularium</I> and salad burnet <I>Sanguisorba minor</I> ssp. <I>minor</I>, and are very rare in the UK. Other unusual forms of species-rich heath occur in Scotland on base-rich glacial drift or on moderately base-rich rocks, such as those on Rum in the Inner Hebrides. These support rare or local species, including northern bedstraw <I>Galium boreale</I>, intermediate wintergreen <I>Pyrola media</I>, stone bramble <I>Rubus saxatilis</I>, alpine bistort <I>Persicaria vivipara</I> and thyme broomrape <I>Orobanche alba</I>. On coastal cliffs and slopes there are maritime H7 <I>Calluna – Scilla </I>heaths with spring squill <I>Scilla verna</I>,<I> </I>including an unusual lichen-rich waved form in the far north on Orkney and Shetland.</P></p>

The dry heath in Ashdown Forest is an extensive example of the south-eastern H2 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Ulex minor</i> community. This vegetation type is dominated by heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>, bell heather <i>Erica cinerea</i> and dwarf gorse <i>Ulex minor</i>, with transitions to other habitats.

Ballochbuie supports one of the largest remaining continuous areas of native <b>91C0 Caledonian forest</b>, situated on the slopes of the Dee valley below the foothills of the Lochnagar massif. Mostly within the former limits of the forest, the site also supports extensive areas of dry heath, along with smaller areas of <b>wet heath</b>. The <b>European dry heath</b> comprises representative examples of the characteristic communities of north-east Scotland, i.e. NVC types H12 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> heath and H16 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i> heath. Forms of H21 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> – <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> heath are also represented, especially in open areas within the forest. Small stands of juniper <i>Juniperus communis</i> (a non-qualifying feature at this site) are found along the upper margins of the forest. On ridges and hill-tops, the dry heath grades to subalpine heaths. Close to the forest, interrupted clubmoss <i>Lycopodium annotinum</i> occurs locally in the heath, along with cloudberry <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i>. Heathy glades in the forest are locally enriched with species such as nodding melick <i>Melica nutans</i> and stone bramble <i>Rubus saxatilis</i>.    </div>

Beinn a’Ghlo has a similar range of <b>European dry heaths</b> to the Cairngorms and similarly is representative of the upland heaths of the cool and less oceanic north-east of Scotland. The dry heaths are even more predominant than on the Cairngorms, occupying almost half of the total area of the site. The principal NVC types present are H12 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> heath, H18 <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> – <i>Deschampsia flexuosa</i> heath and H16 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i> heath, mostly occurring on acid soils developed over quartzite, giving good examples of species-poor heath. The most extensive type from low to high altitudes on the site, typical of the eastern Highlands, is <i>Calluna</i> – <i>Vaccinium</i> heath. There are also good examples of snow-bed forms of <i>Vaccinium</i> – <i>Deschampsia</i> heath developed at the upper limit of dry heath in which late snow-lie causes a replacement of heather <i>Calluna</i> by bilberry <i>Vaccinium</i> spp. On gradations to limestone soils there are some examples of herb-rich heath. There are well-developed transitions to <b>4060 Alpine and Boreal heaths</b>.    </div>

    <div>
The dry heaths of Breckland are representative of <b>European dry heaths</b> in East Anglia, in eastern England, developed under a semi-continental climate. Breckland has an average annual precipitation of only 600 mm, relatively hot summers and cold winters. Frosts can occur in any month of the year. The dry acidic heath of Breckland represents H1 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Festuca ovina</i> heath in the SAC series. The sand sedge-dominated <i>Carex arenaria</i> sub-community (H1d) is typical of areas of blown sand – a very unusual feature of this location. The highly variable soils of Breckland, with underlying chalk being largely covered with wind-blown sands, have resulted in mosaics of heather-dominated heathland, acidic grassland and calcareous grassland that are unlike those of any other site. In many places there is a linear or patterned distribution of heath and grassland, arising from fossilised soil patterns that formed under peri-glacial conditions. Breckland is important for rare plants, such as perennial knawel <i>Scleranthus perennis</i> ssp. <i>prostratus</i>, and rare invertebrates.    </div>

The area of lowland heathland at Cannock Chase is the most extensive in the Midlands, although there have been losses due to fragmentation and scrub/woodland encroachment. The character of the vegetation is intermediate between the upland or northern heaths of England and Wales and those of southern counties. Dry heathland communities belong to NVC types H8 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Ulex gallii</i> and H9 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Deschampsia flexuosa</i> heaths. Within the heathland, species of northern latitudes occur, such as cowberry <i>Vaccinium vitis-idaea</i> and crowberry <i>Empetrum nigrum</i>. Cannock Chase has the main British population of the hybrid bilberry <i>Vaccinium intermedium</i>, a plant of restricted occurrence.

This site comprises 37 SSSIs with fine transitions between <B>4010 Northern Atlantic wet heaths with <I>Erica tetralix</I></B>, dry heaths and other habitats. Dry heath NVC types include H2 <I>Calluna vulgaris</I> – <I>Ulex minor</I>, H3 <I>Ulex minor</I> – <I>Agrostis curtisii</I>, H4 <I>Ulex gallii</I> – <I>Agrostis curtisii</I> and H8 <I>Calluna vulgaris</I> – <I>Ulex gallii</I>. The area of heathland has been reduced and fragmented, with about 86% lost since the mid-18<SUP>th</SUP> century. However, the Dorset heaths represent some of the biggest and finest remaining areas of lowland heathland in the UK. The dry heath occurs on very infertile soils and is not very diverse botanically, but occasionally some nationally scarce plants occur, such as mossy stonecrop <I>Crassula tillaea</I> and yellow centaury <I>Cicendia filiformis</I>. In places, where heather <I>Calluna vulgaris</I> occurs in mature stands, lichens of the genus <I>Cladonia</I> are very abundant. Uncommon features of the south-eastern heathlands are the localised presence of bilberry <I>Vaccinium myrtillus</I> and the co-existence in some areas of western gorse <I>Ulex gallii</I> and dwarf gorse <I>U. minor</I>. The dry heaths support populations of European importance of several species, including rare butterflies (e.g. silver-studded blue <I>Plebejus argus</I>), grasshoppers and spiders. Among birds, the dry heath is very important for woodlark <I>Lullula arborea</I>, European nightjar <I>Caprimulgus europaeus</I>, Dartford warbler <I>Sylvia undata</I> and some migrants such as hen harrier <I>Circus cyaneus</I> and Eurasian hobby <I>Falco subbuteo</I>.

North West Pembrokeshire Commons support an important area of <b>European dry heath</b> which consists predominantly of humid H4 <i>Ulex gallii</i> – <i>Agrostis curtisii</i> heath but also with smaller amounts of dry H8 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Ulex gallii</i> heath. The humid heath is an atypical form from that described in the NVC in that bristle bent <i>Agrostis curtisii</i> is absent, but in all other respects the heath conforms to the NVC description, and is the westernmost example of this vegetation type in Wales. The heath forms part of a set of excellent transitions between dry and humid heath to wet heath, various forms of fen meadow vegetation and other habitats. Notable species associated with the heath include pale dog-violet <i>Viola lactea</i> and yellow centaury <i>Cicendia filiformis</i>.    </div>

Rum has examples of <b>European dry heaths</b> typical of the Inner Hebrides but is particularly noted for the presence of species-rich heath on base-rich soils. A large extent of the local, species-rich form of H10 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Erica cinerea</i> heath, <i>Thymus praecox</i> – <i>Carex pulicaris</i> sub-community (H10d), occurs on steep, southerly-facing slopes on ultra-basic rocks. The associated flora includes a number of northern and arctic-alpine species, such as mountain everlasting <i>Antennaria dioica</i>, viviparous sheep’s-fescue <i>Festuca vivipara</i>, alpine meadow-rue <i>Thalictrum alpinum</i>, alpine bistort <i>Persicaria vivipara</i> and alpine saw-wort <i>Saussurea alpina</i>. The associated invertebrate fauna contains large populations of rare and local burnet moths. This northern form of species-rich heath complements that on Great Orme’s Head in Wales, which has a species-rich heath of a much more southern floristic character, overlying limestone. Other kinds of dry heath on Rum are typical of north-west Scotland. They include species-poor H10 <i>Calluna</i> – <i>Erica</i> heath and H21 <i>Calluna</i> – <i>Vaccinium</i> – <i>Sphagnum</i> heath, including some of the Atlantic bryophyte-rich forms of the latter.    </div>

<STRONG>European dry heaths</STRONG> habitat is represented in Scotland by eight heathland NVC types. Slochd supports a good example of one of these, the NVC community H16 <EM>Calluna vulgaris–Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</EM> heath. The H16 community is a characteristic heath of north-east Scotland and is usually developed at moderate altitudes on a variety of freely-drained, acid soils with base-poor parent material. Although not large by the standards of sites selected for other types of dry heath, Slochd is significant in terms of the extent of the H16 heath present, being one of only nine sites known in Scotland with over 50 ha of this heath community. In addition, H16 heath normally occurs in small, scattered fragments, but at Slochd it occurs in a more or less contiguous block. Typical species present at this site include heather <EM>Calluna vulgaris</EM>, wavy hair-grass <EM>Deschampsia flexuosa</EM>, bell heather <EM>Erica cinerea</EM> and cowberry <EM>Vaccinium vitis-idaea</EM>. Bearberry <EM>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</EM> is most frequent at Slochd where the heather is shortest, particularly on the top of the hill, but it is present on both north- and south-facing slopes throughout the site, which lies between 350 m and 450 m above sea level. As well as <EM>A. uva-ursi</EM>, the other rather uncommon species recorded on the site are <EM>Genista anglica</EM>, <EM>Juniperus communis</EM>, <EM>Pyrola media</EM>, <EM>Trientalis europaea</EM>, and the lichen <EM>Cladonia rangiferina</EM>.

The site is representative of upland dry heath at the southern end of the Pennine range, the habitat’s most south-easterly upland location in the UK. Dry heath covers extensive areas, occupies the lower slopes of the moors on mineral soils or where peat is thin, and occurs in transitions to acid grassland, wet heath and <b>7130 blanket bogs</b>. The upland heath of the South Pennines is strongly dominated by heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>. Its main NVC types are H9 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Deschampsia flexuosa</i> heath and H12 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> heath. More rarely H8 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Ulex gallii</i> heath and H10 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Erica cinerea</i> heath are found. On the higher, more exposed ground H18 <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> – <i>Deschampsia flexuosa</i> heath becomes more prominent.

The New Forest represents <b>European dry heaths</b> in southern England and is the largest area of lowland heathland in the UK. It is particularly important for the diversity of its habitats and the range of rare and scarce species which it supports.
