            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p><B>
<P>Active raised bogs</B> are peat-forming ecosystems that have developed during thousands of years of peat accumulation, to such an extent that the depth of peat isolates them from the influence of groundwater. Typically, lowland raised bogs form a raised dome of peat irrigated solely by rainfall. Such rainwater-fed ecosystems are very acid and poor in plant nutrients and typically support a restricted range of species, some of which are otherwise abundant only in the cooler and wetter uplands of the UK. In line with the <a targe="_blank" href="http://europa.eu.int/comm/environment/nature/hab-en.htm"><I>Interpretation manual of European habitats</I></a> (European Commission DG&nbsp;Environment 1999), ‘active’ is defined as ‘supporting a significant area of vegetation that is normally peat-forming’. Such vegetation includes plants such as the bog-mosses <I>Sphagnum</I> spp., cottongrasses <I>Eriophorum</I> spp., heather <I>Calluna vulgaris</I> and other ericaceous plants, and the carnivorous sundews <I>Drosera </I>spp. Under some circumstances purple moor-grass <I>Molinia caerulea</I> is also peat-forming. Northern sites are richer in the reindeer-moss lichen <I>Cladonia</I> spp. Active bog vegetation is characteristic of intact (primary) bog surfaces, but peat-forming communities also occur frequently on bogs which have previously been cut for peat (secondary surfaces) but have since become revegetated.</P>
<P>Within the raised bog ecosystem the bog surface typically displays a distinctive microtopography, with patterns of hummocks and hollows rich in <I>Sphagnum </I>and other peat-forming species. Around bog pools there may sometimes be patches of <B>7150 Depressions on peat substrates of the <I>Rhynchosporion</B></I>. Classical descriptions of the ecosystem show raised bogs as having a discrete lens-shaped dome of peat with flat or imperceptibly sloping topography with a halo of fen vegetation in the zone where water draining the bog meets that from adjoining mineral soils. This is known as the lagg. A characteristic of the lagg zone is that normally it has more available plant nutrients, is more alkaline and hence shows greater species diversity, with a preponderance of sedge <I>Carex </I>spp. As a result of peat-digging and other activities, no example of raised bog that conforms exactly to this model is now known in Europe. Attention has been paid to ensure that sites with remnant lagg vegetation have been selected.</P>
<P>The principal NVC types found on <B>Active raised bogs</B> are: </P>
<UL>
<LI>M1&nbsp; <I>Sphagnum auriculatum </I>bog pool community </LI>
<LI>M2&nbsp; <I>Sphagnum cuspidatum/recurvum </I>bog pool community</LI>
<LI>M3&nbsp; <I>Eriophorum angustifolium </I>bog pool community </LI>
<LI>M18&nbsp; <I>Erica tetralix – Sphagnum papillosum</I> raised and blanket mire</LI>
<LI>M19&nbsp; <I>Calluna vulgaris – Eriophorum vaginatum</I> blanket mire </LI>
<LI>M20&nbsp; <I>Eriophorum vaginatum </I>blanket and raised mire.</LI></UL>
<P>However, this list is not exhaustive. M15&nbsp;<I>Scirpus cespitosus – Erica tetralix</I> wet heath and M16&nbsp;<I>Erica tetralix – Sphagnum compactum</I> wet heath are also found on raised bogs, but are typically found on shallower peats (&lt;0.5&nbsp;m depth) and are generally referable to Annex&nbsp;I type <B>H4010 Northern Atlantic wet heaths with <I>Erica tetralix</B></I>. </P></p>

    <h2>European status and distribution</h2>
    <p>
<P>Raised bogs are found in every EU Member State, with the exception of Luxembourg. Countries known to hold significant concentrations of <B>Active raised bogs</B> include Finland, Sweden, the UK and Ireland.</P></p>
</div>


<div class="section">
    <h2>UK status and distribution</h2>
    <p>
<P>Raised bogs are widespread but unevenly distributed in the UK. There are notable concentrations in several areas, including the Central Belt in Scotland, the Solway region on the England/Scotland border, north-west England and Northern Ireland.</P>
<P>The most comprehensive inventory of raised bogs in Great Britain is the Lowland Raised Bog Inventory (LRBI) (Lindsay &amp; Immirzi 1996); this does not include Northern Ireland. Within GB, the LRBI lists 800 former and existing raised bogs, covering a total area of nearly 700,000&nbsp;ha. However, all of these sites have been modified to some extent by human activity. The LRBI condition classes cannot be converted readily to Annex&nbsp;I categories, and so it is not easy to assess the total GB resource of <B>Active raised bog</B>. Peatland in Northern Ireland has been classified and mapped using air photographs (Cruickshank &amp; Tomlinson 1988). This identified 2,270&nbsp;ha of intact lowland peatland and 20,042&nbsp;ha of ‘cut-over’ peatland, but it is not possible to report separately on the area of ‘active’ or ‘degraded’ raised bog using this information source.</P></p>

    <div>
This peat bog in the central belt of Scotland has complex origins in that it has arisen from peat developing in two separate basins, which have now fused. In the area where peat has merged, the vegetation has affinities to <b>7130 Blanket bogs</b>. The upper and lower bogs are dominated by hummocks largely formed of <i>Sphagnum</i> spp., including <i>S. fuscum</i> and <i>S. imbricatum</i>, and are rich in heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> and cottongrasses <i>Eriophorum</i> spp. Soft <i>S. cuspidatum</i> hollows also occur.    </div>

Coalburn Moss retains an extensive primary dome, although this is now confined by two abandoned railway lines. The site contains one of the larger tracts of vigorous bog-moss-dominated vegetation in the Central Belt of Scotland, with distinctive wet <i>Sphagnum</i> hollows. Typical bog-mosses include <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i> and <i>S. magellanicum</i>. Hare’s-tail cottongrass <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i>, cranberry <i>Vaccinium oxycoccos</i> and reindeer-moss lichen <i>Cladonia</i> spp. are also common.

    </b>
    <div>
This sequence of peat domes (also known as Tregaron Bog) developed on the floodplain of the Afon (River) Teifi in mid-Wales now represents the most intact surviving example in the UK of a raised bog landscape (macrotope). The three main extant domes are hydrologically isolated by the River Teifi and associated surface drainage features, and all three have suffered extensive damage as a consequence of past drainage and peat-cutting. The river terraces associated with the component bog mesotopes are regularly flooded and support vegetation that includes reed canary-grass <I>Phalaris arundinacea</I>, soft rush <I>Juncus effusus</I>, purple moor-grass <I>Molinia caerulea</I> and, more rarely, water sedge <I>Carex aquatilis</I>. Substantial areas of the surface of each of the three component bogs still retain good quality active raised bog vegetation mainly referable to NVC type M18 <I>Sphagnum papillosum</I> – <I>Erica tetralix</I> community, with frequent bog-rosemary <I>Andromeda polifolia</I> and white beak-sedge <I>Rhynchospora alba</I> and, more locally, the bog-mosses <I>Sphagnum magellanicum</I> and <I>S. pulchrum</I>. Extensive areas with a high cover of heather <I>Calluna vulgaris</I> and deergrass <I>Trichophorum cespitosum</I> are also present, while purple moor-grass <I>M. caerulea</I> is particularly prominent on the more modified bog margins. Although present as a important peat-former until as recently as the 18<SUP>th</SUP> century, <I>Sphagnum imbricatum</I> is absent from the contemporary bog flora.     </div>

    <div>
Cors Fochno (also known as Borth Bog) lies on the south side of the Dyfi estuary in Wales and forms a component part of the Dyfi Biosphere Reserve. Although a substantial part of the former peatland complex has been taken for agriculture, the surviving core area supports the largest expanse of primary near-natural raised bog in an estuarine context within the UK. Extensive areas of patterned mire include occasional hummocks of the bog-mosses <i>Sphagnum fuscum</i> and, more rarely, <i>S. imbricatum</i> ssp. <i>austinii</i>, with hollows supporting <i>S. pulchrum</i>, greater sundew <i>Drosera anglica</i>, white beak-sedge <i>Rhynchospora alba</i> and bog-rosemary <i>Andromeda polifolia</i>. The extensive cover of bog-myrtle <i>Myrica gale</i> and maritime margins with black bog-rush <i>Schoenus nigricans</i> are distinctive features of this site in an England and Wales context. Areas of domestic peat-cutting peripheral to the dome are now actively regenerating and support a significant area of active bog vegetation; <b>7120 degraded raised bog</b> also occurs widely around the periphery of the active core.    </div>

Cranley Moss in the central belt of Scotland is important because it is a ‘classic’ raised bog, with a distinct and clearly defined active dome rising from a flat flood-plain long since converted to agricultural use. Much of the bog margin is intact, but although marshy ground surrounds parts of the site, most of the original lagg fen transition is thought to have been reclaimed. The bog has extensive <i>Sphagnum</i> carpets, which show vigorous growth throughout. <i>Sphagnum imbricatum</i> is found here.    </div>

Flanders consists of a cluster of separate bogs in the central belt of Scotland that are the remnants of one of the largest <b>active raised bog</b> complexes in Britain. East Flanders Moss is the largest raised bog in the UK that is still in a predominantly near-natural state. Many of the typical bog-mosses, including <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i> and <i>S. magellanicum</i>, are found in abundance, together with local rarities such as <i>S. fuscum</i>, <i>S. imbricatum</i> and <i>S. molle</i> within a rich diversity of natural microtopographical features. The development of woodland on East Flanders is a recent phenomenon, but where the conditions are sufficiently wet, tree growth is very stunted and the branches are encrusted with rich assemblages of lichen. This may approach the natural conditions of tree growth on raised bog in this part of Scotland. Collymoon Moss previously formed part of a peatland continuum with East Flanders. The ground layer is rich in <i>Sphagnum</i>, but the striking feature of this part of the site is the high proportion of lichens such as reindeer-moss <i>Cladonia</i> spp. Killorn Moss and Shirgarton Moss form small satellites to East Flanders Moss, having once almost certainly been connected to it by fen peat, which has disappeared through agricultural use. These sites have a narrow fringe of woodland giving way to open mire communities, which, in both cases, support vigorous bog-moss vegetation and typical features of raised bog; they are therefore seen as an integral part of the site.    </div>
