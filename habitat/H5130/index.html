            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p>
<P>The relationship between juniper <I>Juniperus communis</I> stands and other types of vegetation is complex. In some cases the stands have no characteristics to separate them from typical examples of heath or calcareous grassland vegetation, except for the abundance of juniper. These are often relatively recent stands. However, at some sites, particularly where the juniper has been present for a longer period, a more distinctive assemblage of species occurs. Here the juniper is associated with other shrubs, shade-tolerant herbs, grazing-sensitive tall herbs, bryophytes and ferns. </P>
<P>The main ecological variation occurs between stands on calcareous substrates (principally chalk and limestone but sometimes calcareous drift) and those found on acid substrates. Calcareous types are mainly found in the southern part of the UK, while acid types are mainly found in northern areas. However, both calcareous and acid types can be found on the same sites in northern England and Scotland. </P>
<P>In northern England and Scotland juniper is found on a wide range of acidic substrates supporting acidophilous plant communities. In many instances these are simply stands of heathland or acidic grassland that have become invaded by juniper. However, at sites where the juniper has been established for longer, the community corresponds to NVC type W19&nbsp;<I>Juniperus communis</I> ssp. <I>communis – Oxalis acetosella</I> woodland. Such vegetation is typically dominated by juniper, with downy birch <I>Betula pubescens </I>and rowan <I>Sorbus aucuparia</I> often scattered throughout. The understorey is rich in acidophilous species, such as bilberry <I>Vaccinium myrtillus</I>, wood-sorrel <I>Oxalis acetosella</I>, heath bedstraw <I>Galium saxatile</I> and hairy wood-rush <I>Luzula pilosa</I>. Species with a northern distribution, including chickweed wintergreen <I>Trientalis europaea</I>, twinflower <I>Linnaea borealis</I> and lesser twayblade <I>Listera cordata</I>, occur locally. There is usually a well-developed layer of pleurocarpous mosses and ferns. On lower slopes with flushing and on more base-rich substrates the flora is enriched by species that reflect an increased base-status, such as common dog-violet <I>Viola riviniana</I>, dog’s mercury <I>Mercurialis perennis</I> and northern bedstraw <I>Galium boreale</I>. </P>
<P>In southern England juniper scrub may develop on a range of calcareous grassland types on thin chalk soils. More closed juniper stands with a rich scrub flora correspond to NVC type W21d&nbsp;<I>Crataegus monogyna – Hedera helix</I> scrub, <I>Viburnum lantana</I> sub-community, formerly called ‘southern mixed scrub’. Where juniper is not dominant the scrub contains a rich assemblage of other shrubs, mainly of the family Rosaceae. Further north, at higher altitude on limestone, juniper scrub is often associated with limestone pavements and calcareous cliffs and screes. Beyond the distribution range of many rosaceous shrubs and often in heavily grazed situations, such scrub may be relatively poor in specialist scrub species. In such circumstances the vegetation has affinities to the species-poor juniper scrub more usually found on acidic substrates. </P>
<P>Juniper stands occur in juxtaposition with a wide range of other vegetation types. Stands of juniper formerly occurred on lowland heathland, but as a result of burning and lack of management, only scattered specimens now survive at a few sites. In the Scottish Highlands there are stands that are transitional to <B>H91C0 Caledonian forest</B> and birch woodlands. Some southern stands are transitional to beech woodlands. In upland areas, specifically the Cairngorms, stands are still found in an apparently natural context at the upper limit of tree development and extend up above the woods into the dwarf-shrub heaths of the alpine zone. Elsewhere, stands occur that are transitional to calcareous grassland, heath, acidic grassland, rock outcrops, <B>8240 Limestone pavements</B>, scree and cliffs. A range of juniper scrub types may occur within individual sites, and these may include both calcareous and acidic forms, altitudinal variations and transitions to a range of habitats.</P>
<P>Patches of <I>Juniperus – Oxalis </I>woodland within stands of W18&nbsp;<I>Pinus sylvestris – Hylocomium splendens</I> woodland are referable to Annex&nbsp;I type <B>H91C0 Caledonian forest</B>. H15&nbsp;dwarf juniper <I>Juniperus communis</I> ssp. <I>alpina</I> heath is referable to Annex&nbsp;I type <B>4060 Alpine and Boreal heaths</B>.</P></p>

The Cairngorms has the third-largest extent of juniper <b><i>Juniperus communis</i> formations</b> in the UK and is one of several sites representing the habitat type in north-east Scotland. The site is exceptional for the wide range of ecological situations in which juniper occurs. Creag Fhiaclach is unique in having the most natural altitudinal tree-line in the UK. At around 640 m there is mixed tree-line woodland with stunted Scots pine <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> and juniper, giving way at higher altitude to alpine juniper scrub. The alpine juniper scrub is developed extensively and often occurs in a stunted form transitional between ssp. <i>communis</i> and ssp. <i>nana</i>. On most of the site juniper occurs on acidic granite, while at Inchrory juniper occurs on both neutral and calcareous soils. Juniper also occurs at the margins and as part of the understorey of <b>91C0 Caledonian forest</b> within the site.    </div>

The Lake District High Fells represents <b><i>Juniperus communis</i> formations</b> on upland acid substrates in north-west England. Three of the component upland SSSIs have extensive areas of juniper <i>Juniperus communis</i>, whilst scattered juniper occurs on many of the inaccessible cliffs and slopes throughout the complex. The NVC type is W19 <i>Juniperus communis</i> ssp. communis – <i>Oxalis acetosella</i> juniper woodland. Birk Fell supports the most extensive stand of juniper in the Lake District. The juniper is associated with open silver birch <i>Betula pendula</i> woods with scattered rowan <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i>, ash <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>, bird cherry <i>Prunus padus</i>, holly <i>Ilex aquifolium</i>, hawthorn <i>Crataegus monogyna</i> and dog rose <i>Rosa canina</i>. Bracken <i>Pteridium aquilinum</i> or fescue – bent grassland with bryophytes and wood sorrel <i>Oxalis acetosella</i> predominate over the woodland floor, although locally there are richer areas. There are good transitions to upland oak woodland and upland habitats such as dry heath and blanket bog. Helvellyn and Fairfield and Skiddaw Group support extensive stands of juniper. Associated species here include ash <i>F. excelsior</i>, sessile oak <i>Quercus petraea</i>, birch <i>B. pendula</i> and rowan <i>S. aucuparia</i>. The ground flora is either <i>Nardus</i> – <i>Festuca</i> – <i>Agrostis</i> grassland or dry heath.    </div>

This site represents <b><i>Juniperus communis</i> formations</b> on a more acidic substrate in north-east England. It has the second most extensive area of juniper scrub in UK and the largest south of Scotland. The main area of juniper scrub grows on the igneous whin-sill, at moderately high altitude. In Upper Teesdale the juniper has developed mainly on heath and is of the W19 <i>Juniperus communis</i> – <i>Oxalis acetosella</i> type. There are transitions to dwarf-shrub heath, acidic grasslands and whin-sill cliffs. Small patches of juniper scrub also occur on calcareous soils, including the sugar limestone grassland for which this site is famous. Palaeo-environmental evidence indicates that juniper scrub has been present continuously since the last glacial period.    </div>

    <div>
Morrone Birkwood is one of several sites representing juniper <b><i>Juniperus communis</i> formations</b> in north-east Scotland. It has the most extensive and diverse example of a transition between woodland and juniper scrub in the UK. The site contains examples of juniper developed both on limestone drift soil and on contrasting acidic soils. The stands on lime-rich soils are the largest and most diverse in Scotland. The flora is species-rich, with a well-developed northern component. This includes rare species usually associated with Scots pine <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> woods, such as twinflower <i>Linnaea borealis</i>, serrated wintergreen <i>Orthilia secunda</i> and interrupted clubmoss <i>Lycopodium annotinum</i>. Nodding mellick <i>Melica nutans</i>, globeflower <i>Trollius europaeus</i> and northern bedstraw <i>Galium boreale</i> also occur. Juniper is actively regenerating on the open slopes above the wood. Pollen analysis indicates that the wood has not altered floristically since the post-glacial period. Other habitats associated with the limestone include <b>6210 Semi-natural dry grasslands and scrubland facies on calcareous substrates</b>, <b>7220 Petrifying springs with tufa formation</b>, <b>7230 Alkaline fens</b> and <b>7240 Alpine pioneer formations of the <i>Caricion bicoloris-atrofuscae</i></b>.    </div>

Morven and Mullachdubh is one of several sites representing <b><i>Juniperus communis</i> formations</b> in north-east Scotland. It has the largest known area of juniper scrub in the UK, about double the extent occurring at any other site. The juniper is developed amongst dry heath and acidic grasslands. The ground flora beneath the juniper is locally rich in ferns, including oak fern <i>Gymnocarpium dryopteris</i> and hard-fern <i>Blechnum spicant</i>. Common woodland herbs, such as wood-sorrel <i>Oxalis acetosella</i> and hairy woodrush <i>Luzula pilosa</i> are widespread. Wood anemone <i>Anemone nemorosa</i> and moschatel <i>Adoxa moschatellina</i> also occur. Of particular interest is the extensive development of juniper up to high altitude, where there is a transition to lichen-rich alpine heaths.    </div>
