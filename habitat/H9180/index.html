            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p><B><I>
<P>Tilio-Acerion</B></I> ravine forests are woods of ash <I>Fraxinus excelsior</I>, wych elm <I>Ulmus glabra</I> and lime (mainly small-leaved lime <I>Tilia cordata</I> but more rarely large-leaved lime <I>T.&nbsp;platyphyllos</I>). Introduced sycamore <I>Acer pseudoplatanus</I> is often present and is a common part of the community in mainland Europe, where it is native. The habitat type typically occurs on nutrient-rich soils that often accumulate in the shady micro-climates towards the bases of slopes and ravines. Therefore it is found on calcareous substrates associated with coarse scree, cliffs, steep rocky slopes and ravines, where inaccessibility has reduced human impact. It often occurs as a series of scattered patches grading into other types of woodland on level valley floors and on slopes above, or as narrow strips along stream-sides. More extensive stands occur on limestone and other base-rich rocks. </P>
<P>This habitat type is ecologically variable, particularly with respect to the dominant tree species. To the north and west, ash and wych elm assume increasing importance in the canopy, and lime may be completely absent. Floristic differences due to variations in slope, aspect and nature of the substrate add to the diversity of the habitat. The ground flora can be very varied, but the following elements are usually present: fern banks (particularly hart’s-tongue <I>Phyllitis scolopendrium</I>, soft shield-fern <I>Polystichum setiferum</I> and<I> </I>buckler-ferns <I>Dryopteris </I>spp.);<I> </I>stands of ramsons <I>Allium ursinum </I>in the moister zones; dog’s mercury <I>Mercurialis perennis</I> and enchanter’s-nightshade <I>Circaea</I> spp. on drier but still base-rich soils; wood avens <I>Geum urbanum</I>, and natural ‘disturbance communities’ comprising common nettle <I>Urtica dioica</I>, herb-Robert <I>Geranium robertianum </I>and<I> </I>cleavers<I> Galium aparine </I>associated with scree and cliff-bases. A wide range of other basiphilous herbs and grasses may occur within these stands.</P>
<P>The main NVC types conforming to <B><I>Tilio-Acerion</I> forests </B>are the ‘western’ forms (sub-communities d-g) of W8&nbsp;<I>Fraxinus excelsior – Acer campestre-Mercurialis perennis</I> woodland, and the equivalent north-western community W9&nbsp;<I>Fraxinus excelsior – Sorbus aucuparia – Mercurialis perennis </I>woodland.</P>
<P>North of the central belt in Scotland, and in upland areas generally, base-rich conditions tend to become more restricted in extent; birch <I>Betula</I> spp. and oak <I>Quercus </I>spp. assume greater abundance in the canopy, and species typical of more acidic communities are often found in a close mosaic with more basiphilous indicators. However, the type is still recognisable in, for example, the hazel <I>Corylus avellana</I> stands of the north-west coast of Scotland rich in lichens and higher plants.</P><B><I>
<P>Tilio-Acerion</I> forests</B> provide a habitat for a number of uncommon vascular plants, including, dark-red helleborine <I>Epipactis atrorubens</I>, violet helleborine <I>Epipactis purpurata</I>, wood fescue <I>Festuca altissima</I>, purple gromwell <I>Lithospermum purpureocaeruleum</I> and herb-Paris <I>Paris quadrifolia</I>. Many sites support notable bryophytes, in particular calcicoles associated with base-rich rock outcrops and (in western stands) Atlantic species. Some localities have important assemblages of epiphytic lichens.</P></p>

    <h2>European status and distribution</h2>
    <p><B><I>
<P>Tilio-Acerion</B></I> has its centre of distribution in continental Europe, but is widespread from Scandinavia through to the Pyrenees and into Italy. Typically it occurs in association with base-rich rocks in the steep-sided immature river valleys of the colline, sub-montane and high mountain belts across Europe.</P></p>
</div>


<div class="section">
    <h2>UK status and distribution</h2>
    <p><B><I>
<P>Tilio-Acerion</B></I> <B>forests </B>are not extensive in the UK, although fragmentary stands are widespread. The UK stands of <B><I>Tilio-Acerion</B></I> <B>forests</B> closest in composition to the stands in mainland Europe tend to occur on the upland-lowland boundary in England and on the Welsh border. Fragmentary outlying stands of similar composition occur in chalk combes in south-east England, while related stands occur also in the north and west.</P></p>

    <div>
Avon Gorge is representative of <b><i>Tilio-Acerion</i> forests</b> in south-west England on the limestone cliffs and screes of a large river gorge. It is important because of the high concentration of small-leaved lime <i>Tilia cordata</i>, compared with other sites in the region, the presence of rare whitebeams <i>Sorbus</i> spp., including two unique to the Avon Gorge (<i>S. bristoliensis</i> and <i>S. wilmottiana</i>), and other uncommon plants, such as green hellebore <i>Helleborus viridis</i>. Other characteristic species include soft shield-fern <i>Polystichum setiferum</i> and hart’s-tongue <i>Phyllitis scolopendrium</i>. Species-rich transitions to scrub and grasslands are associated with the woodland. Small groves of yew <i>Taxus baccata</i> also occur on some of the stonier situations.    </div>

The Lower Findhorn Woods represent <b><i>Tilio-Acerion</i> forest</b> in the north-eastern part of its range in the UK. The River Findhorn flows through a deep gorge, the sides of which are cloaked in ancient semi-natural woodland, and there are some very good stands of the habitat scattered along the 7 km length of this site, wherever suitable topographic and soil conditions occur. The ground flora is species-rich with good floristic assemblages and several locally rare species, and the outstanding epiphytic lichen flora represents a highly continental type similar to that of dry mixed oak forests in southern Scandinavia.    </div>

Mendip Woodlands in south-west England is a relatively extensive example of <b><i>Tilio-Acerion</i> forests</b> on limestone. It is a cluster of three ash-dominated woods on Carboniferous limestone. A rich variety of other trees and shrubs are present, including elm <i>Ulmus</i> spp. and, locally, small-leaved lime <i>Tilia cordata</i>. At Ebbor Gorge elm rather than lime is mixed with ash <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i> in a steep-sided gorge; at both Rodney Stoke and Cheddar Wood lime and ash are found on rocky slopes with patches of deeper soil between the outcrops. Ferns characteristic of this woodland type, such as hart’s-tongue <i>Phyllitis scolopendrium</i> and shield-ferns <i>Polystichum</i> spp., are common. The site is in the centre of the range of common dormouse <i>Muscardinus avellanarius</i> and holds a large population of this species.    </div>

Rook Clift is the largest known remnant stand of <b><i>Tilio-Acerion</i> forests</b> dominated by large-leaved lime <i>Tilia platyphyllos</i> in the south of England. It lies on the deeper soils towards the base of the slope and valley bottom of a small wooded combe, which gives the site its humid microclimate. The soils are rather deeper and there is less exposed rock at this site because the chalk is more readily weathered than the limestones on which many of the other sites lie. Despite this, the vegetation is otherwise typical of the habitat type, with an abundance of ferns such as hart’s-tongue <i>Phyllitis scolopendrium</i> and shield-fern <i>Polystichum</i> spp. In addition to species more common in the west of Britain, continental species such as Italian lords-and-ladies <i>Arum italicum</i> also occur.    </div>
