            <h2>Description and ecological characteristics</h2>
            <p>
<P>This habitat type comprises a range of woodland types dominated by mixtures of oak (<I>Quercus robur</I> and/or <I>Q. petraea</I>) and birch (<I>Betula pendula</I> and/or <I>B. pubescens</I>). It is characteristic of base-poor soils in areas of at least moderately high rainfall in northern and western parts of the UK.</P>
<P>The habitat corresponds broadly to the ‘western oakwoods’ described in previous accounts of UK woodlands, particularly NVC types: </P>
<UL>
<LI>W10e  <I>Quercus robur – Pteridium aquilinum – Rubus fruticosus</I> woodland, <I>Acer pseudoplatanus – Oxalis acetosella</I> sub-community </LI>
<LI>W11  <I>Quercus petraea – Betula pubescens – Oxalis acetosella</I> woodland</LI>
<LI>W16b <I>Quercus</I> spp.<I> – Betula</I> spp.<I> – Deschampsia flexuosa</I> woodland, <I>Vaccinium myrtillus</I> <I>– Dryopteris dilatata</I> sub-community</LI>
<LI>W17  <I>Quercus petraea – Betula pubescens – Dicranum majus</I> woodland </LI></UL>
<P>The habitat shows considerable variation across its range, in terms of the associated ground flora and the richness of bryophyte communities. There is also a continuous spectrum of variation between oak-dominated and birch-dominated stands. Often these local variations reflect factors such as rainfall, slope, aspect, soil depth, and past and present woodland management (e.g. coppicing, planting, grazing). The most distinctive forms of the habitat have a ground flora dominated by bryophytes, such as <I>Dicranum majus</I>, <I>Hylocomium splendens</I>, <I>Isothecium myosuroides</I>, <I>Plagiothecium undulatum</I>, <I>Rhytidiadelphus loreus</I>, <I>Bazzania trilobata</I> and <I>Plagiochila spinulosa</I>. Other variants include stands in which the ground flora is characterised by the prominence of dwarf shrubs, such as bilberry <I>Vaccinium myrtillus</I>; grasses, such as wavy hair-grass <I>Deschampsia flexuosa</I>, common bent <I>Agrostis capillaris</I> and sweet vernal-grass <I>Anthoxanthum odoratum</I>; and plants indicative of more mesophytic conditions, including bluebell <I>Hyacinthoides non-scripta</I>,<I> </I>bramble <I>Rubus fruticosus</I>, scaly male-fern <I>Dryopteris affinis</I>.</P>
<P>Birch-dominated woodlands which contain at least some oak, and which either (a) occur as part of an intimate mosaic with oak-dominated stands, or (b) are clearly successional stages which are reverting to oak woodland, are included in the Annex I definition. However, birch woodlands in Scotland which lie beyond the present-day natural distribution of oak, and also those within this range for which there is no historical evidence for the presence of oak, are excluded from the Annex I type. </P>
<P>Frequently the oak woodland occurs as part of a mosaic of woodland types (including other Annex I habitats, such as <B>9180 <I>Tilio-Acerion</I> forests of slopes, screes and ravines</B> and <B>91E0</B> <B>Alluvial forests with <I>Alnus glutinosa </I>and <I>Fraxinus excelsior </I>(<I>Alno-Padion</I>, <I>Alnion incanae</I>, <I>Salicion albae</I>)</B>) that varies with position on the slope, occurrence of streams or other waterbodies, and local soil enrichment. These transitions are important in maintaining the structure and function of the habitat type and differ across the country. </P>
<P>A key feature of European importance is the rich Atlantic bryophyte communities that are often well-developed within this Annex I type. These include numerous rare species, such as <I>Campylopus setifolius</I>,<I> Sematophyllum demissum</I>,<I> Adelanthus decipiens</I>, <I>Leptoscyphus cuneifolius</I> and <I>Plagiochila atlantica</I>.<I> </I>Fourteen different bryophyte zones have been identified in the UK (Ratcliffe 1968), with distinct differences in the bryophyte assemblages within them. The richest zones are in the western Scottish Highlands. Stands of <B>old sessile oak woods</B> in eastern Britain tend to be much smaller and less distinctive in their species composition, particularly their bryophyte assemblages.</P>
<P>In addition to the bryophyte zones, there are distinct differences in higher plant and animal assemblages in the south compared with the north. Some woodlands hold rich lichen floras, especially epiphytic assemblages such as the <I>Lobarion</I> community.</P></p>

        Highlands and Islands
    </b>
    <div>
This complex of woods represents <b>old sessile oak woods</b> at the extreme north of its range in Scotland. The site includes the extensive and diverse Ardvar Woodlands, which are mainly birch-dominated with oak throughout, and the woodland at Loch a’Mhuilinn, the other component of this complex, to the north, which has small areas dominated by oak. The area of woodland at Loch a’Mhuilinn lies on the north-west coast of Sutherland near sea level where the effects of exposure on the growth form of some of the oaks are particularly well-demonstrated. The oaks are of special interest because they are the most northern remnant of native oak woodland in the British Isles. Both sites are very important rich oceanic bryophyte sites with good examples of the macrolichen <i>Lobarion</i> community.    </div>

    <div>
Banagher Glen in the foothills of the Sperrin Mountains is one of the largest and least disturbed examples of <b>old sessile oak woods</b> in Northern Ireland. The site has a long history of continuous woodland cover, and has a well-developed structure with a range of different layers present. The naturalness of the wood is exemplified by the low number of non-native species and the relative abundance of old trees and epiphytes. The acid woodland flora is characterised by a canopy of sessile oak <i>Quercus petraea</i> and occasional downy birch <i>Betula pubescens</i>, with a ground flora of grasses, including wavy hair-grass <i>Deschampsia flexuosa</i>, and calcifuge mosses such as <i>Rhytidiadelphus loreus</i>. Where grazing is absent, bilberry <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> is dominant. Where conditions are rather less acidic, hazel <i>Corylus avellana</i> is occasional in the shrub layer, with great wood-rush <i>Luzula sylvatica</i> and bluebell <i>Hyacinthoides non-scripta</i> in the ground flora. The wood contains a rich variety of plants and includes a number of notable bryophytes and lichens.    </div>

Breen Wood is one of the best examples of <b>old sessile oak woods</b> in Northern Ireland. It is traversed by glacial outflow channels that have formed a series of dry, low ridges interspersed by damp, narrow valleys. Over these freely-draining and leached slopes, the wood is strongly calcifugous in nature, with a high canopy of downy birch <i>Betula pubescens</i> and oak <i>Quercus</i> spp. The shrub layer is composed of rowan <i>Sorbus aucuparia</i> with some holly <i>Ilex aquifolium</i>. The field layer is dominated by bilberry <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>, with occasional bramble <i>Rubus fruticosus</i> agg., honeysuckle <i>Lonicera periclymenum</i> and ferns, typically bracken <i>Pteridium aquilinum</i>. The herb layer is overwhelmingly dominated by extensive carpets of great wood-rush <i>Luzula sylvatica</i>. The only other species that occur to any significant extent are hard fern <i>Blechnum spicant</i> and wood-sorrel <i>Oxalis acetosella</i>. Breen Wood is the only known location in Northern Ireland for the moss <i>Hylocomium umbratum</i>.    </div>

Three main areas of oak woodland are included within this site. Wistman’s Wood is notable as a high-altitude relict surviving on a granite clitter slope. Unusually for old oak woods in the UK, it is dominated by pedunculate oak <I>Quercus robur</I> rather than sessile oak <I>Q. petraea</I>. The epiphytic and ground-covering bryophyte flora, with filmy ferns, is species-rich, although there are some indications that some species may have declined in recent years, possibly because as the tree canopy has grown conditions below it have become less humid. Wistman’s Wood has a well-documented record of changes over the last century. <BR><BR>Dendles Wood is dominated by pedunculate oak <I>Q. robur</I>, but with substantial areas of beech <I>Fagus sylvatica</I> on the lower slopes (considered to be a possible outlier of the native range of beech). The ground flora is a mixture of grasses, bracken <I>Pteridium aquilinum</I>, bluebell <I>Hyacinthoides non-scripta</I>, with locally many boulders supporting a species-rich bryophyte mat. There is a luxuriant epiphytic lichen flora including several rare species.

The site contains habitat representative of <STRONG>old sessile oak woods with <EM>Ilex</EM> and <EM>Blechnum</EM></STRONG>. The site comprises two distinct blocks of oak wood, separated by the River Shira and associated areas of open and grazed ground which are excluded from the site. The orientation of the valley means that the woodland is situated on both north-west and south-east facing slopes, which has encouraged the development of greater diversity. The qualifying oakwood habitat in the western part of the site is interspersed with areas of non-qualifying alder–ash woodland and patches of open ground where regeneration is occurring. The eastern block consists almost entirely of qualifying old sessile oak wood, mainly oak-dominated, with alder <EM>Alnus glutinosa</EM>, ash <EM>Fraxinus excelsior</EM> and hazel <EM>Corylus avellana</EM> also present. The main NVC types representing old sessile oak woods across the site are W11 and W17.

        Extra-Regio, Highlands and Islands
    </b>
    <div>
Sunart on the west coast of Scotland contains the richest complex of Atlantic bryophyte-rich <b>old sessile oak woods</b> in the UK and is representative of the mid-west Highlands bryophyte zone. The site is also characterised by one of the UK’s most extensive areas of ancient semi-natural woodland, much of which is oak-dominated. However, the woodland canopy is varied, with areas of birch <i>Betula</i> spp., ash <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i> and hazel <i>Corylus avellana</i>, and alder <i>Alnus glutinosa</i> on wet ground. Typically, oak-dominated woodland on lower slopes gives way to birch woodland at higher altitudes, and uninterrupted transitions to marine habitats are found along the shore, a rare situation in British woodlands. The woods support a rich fern flora and an impressive range of lichens, including well-developed lungwort <i>Lobarion</i> spp. communities and many rarities. The rare chequered skipper butterfly <i>Carterocephalus palaemon</i> has a strong population within these woods.    </div>

        Highlands and Islands
    </b>
    <div>
Tarbert Woods comprises a large coastal strip of fragmented broad-leaved woodland with good stands of <b>old sessile oak woods</b>, which are very important for their oceanic bryophyte communities. The numerous streams which traverse the site have in places cut deep ravines, and together with the sheltered north-east aspect these provide very humid conditions which support thriving populations of ferns and bryophytes. Amongst the 180 bryophyte species recorded are 47 Atlantic species, including <i>Sematophyllum micans</i> and <i>Plagiochila atlantica</i>. The woodland rises in altitude from sea level up to 150 m within around 450 m of the coast, and as a consequence shows marked community zonation. The lower slopes are dominated by oak-birch <i>Quercus-Betula</i> woodland, and downy birch <i>Betula pubescens</i> is the dominant tree throughout the woods with little sign of past management specifically as oak woodland, except around old settlements. Ash <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i> woodland is associated with many of the streams and ravines where more base-rich conditions prevail, whilst areas of alder and willow occur near the coast.     </div>

This continuous block of woodland on the west coast of Scotland is representative of <b>old sessile oak woods</b> in the rich south-west Highlands bryophyte zone. The site is notable for its outstanding lichen and bryophyte communities, which include species with a predominantly southern distribution, such as the rare <i>Physcia clementei</i>. In the less acidic areas a rich ground flora occurs, including narrow-leaved helleborine <i>Cephalanthera longifolia</i>. There are also transitions to open bog-filled hollows with the Annex II species <b>1065 Marsh fritillary <i>Euphydryas aurinia</i></b> and several small mesotrophic lochs.    </div>

    <div>
Stretches of <b>old sessile oak wood</b> occur at various points along this section of coast. The trees are frequently wind-pruned, sometimes to the point where they are barely taller than the heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i>. The oak communities include small patches of richer ash <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i> and alder <i>Alnus glutinosa</i> woodland. The bryophyte and lichen assemblages are particularly rich, and the Atlantic influence is also shown in the abundance of hay-scented buckler-fern <i>Dryopteris aemula</i>.    </div>

    <div>
This complex of ancient, semi-natural woodland sites is one of the largest and most diverse in central Scotland, and represents <b>old sessile oak woods</b> within the South-west Highlands Atlantic bryophyte zone. The woodland is largely dominated by sessile oak <i>Quercus petraea</i> with downy birch <i>Betula pubescens</i> on acid soils. Within localised pockets, nutrient enrichment occurs, giving rise to ash <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i>, and where groundwater flushing occurs alder <i>Alnus glutinosa</i> dominates with ash and hazel <i>Corylus avellana</i>. The islands within Loch Katrine support ungrazed tree and shrub communities including juniper <i>Juniperus communis</i>. The ground flora of both sites in the complex is rich and the complex is notable for the presence of <i>Bazzania trilobata</i>, a liverwort typical of more western oceanic oakwoods.    </div>

Around Ullswater there is a cluster of <b>old sessile oak woods</b>, sometimes in association with other woodland types of ash <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i> and alder <i>Alnus glutinosa</i>.

Upper Lough Erne represents one of the largest areas of semi-natural woodland remaining in Northern Ireland. Drier soils support mature stands of <b>old sessile oak woods</b>, which are particularly well-developed to the south of the lough. The woodlands consist of a canopy dominated by oak <i>Quercus petraea</i>, with occasional ash <i>Fraxinus excelsior</i> and birch <i>Betula pubescens</i>. Hazel <i>Corylus avellana</i> and holly <i>Ilex aquifolium</i> often form a distinct shrub layer. The ground flora is very variable and consists of a wide variety of species, including bluebell <i>Hyacinthoides non-scripta</i>, sanicle <i>Sanicula europaea</i>, goldilocks buttercup <i>Ranunculus auricomus</i>, great wood-rush <i>Luzula sylvatica</i>, and an abundance of the scarce thin-spiked wood-sedge <i>Carex strigosa</i>.    </div>

This complex of sites in Central Scotland contains examples of <b>old sessile oak woods</b> towards the eastern end of the habitat’s range within Scotland. It is one of two sites within the series representing the Eastern Highlands Atlantic Bryophyte zone. The complex includes one of the most extensive deciduous woodlands in Tayside, which was formerly managed for coppice wood production and is now comprised largely of non-singled stems which give a good structural diversity. Several sub-oceanic epiphytic bryophytes occur, and one of the woods is of national importance for its lichen flora with an outstandingly high number of epiphytic species including many characteristic of old woodland.    </div>
