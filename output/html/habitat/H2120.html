<h4>Description and ecological characteristics</h4>
<p><B>
<P>Shifting dunes along the shoreline with <I>Ammophila arenaria </I>(&quot;white dunes&quot;)</B> encompasses most of the vegetation of unstable dunes where there is active sand movement. Under these conditions sand-binding marram <I>Ammophila arenaria</I> is always a prominent feature of the vegetation and is usually dominant. In the UK the majority of such vegetation falls within NVC type SD6&nbsp;<I>Ammophila arenaria</I> mobile dune community. This is a dynamic vegetation type maintained only by change. It can occur on both accreting and eroding dunes, but will rapidly change and disappear if stability is imposed. It rarely occurs in isolation because of its dynamic nature and because it is successionally related to other dune habitats. The habitat type excludes the low, embryonic dunes where occasional exposure to saltwater flooding constrains the growth of marram and where plants of the strandline mingle with salt-tolerant, sand-binding grasses; such vegetation is referable to Annex&nbsp;I type <B>2110 Embryonic shifting dunes</B>.</P>
<P>The species composition of shifting dunes is constrained by the harsh conditions, but the vegetation is by no means uniform. The most marked floristic variation relates to the degree of instability. Where sand accretion is extremely rapid it is possible to find vegetation that consists only of <I>A.&nbsp;arenaria</I>. As rates of sand deposition decline the marram is joined by more species, first by other specialised dune plants, then by less specialised grasses, drought-tolerant annuals and a restricted number of specialised bryophytes such as the moss <I>Tortula ruralis</I> ssp. <I>ruraliformis</I>. This moss plays an important part in completing the stabilisation of the sand surface. Towards the seaward edge of the zone of shifting dunes, salt-tolerant plants such as sea sandwort <I>Honckenya peploides</I> may be prominent, along with the sand-binding sand couch <I>Elytrigia juncea</I>. Further inland these species are rarely prominent. </P>
<P>There is also geographical variation in the floristic composition of the habitat type. A number of typical shifting dune plants such as Portland spurge <I>Euphorbia portlandica</I> and sea-holly <I>Eryngium maritimum</I> are mostly confined to the south of the UK, while lyme-grass <I>Leymus arenarius</I> is much more abundant in the northern half of Britain, where the vegetation may fall within the NVC type SD5&nbsp;<I>Leymus arenarius</I> mobile dune community. </P></p>

Marram <i>Ammophila arenaria</i> usually dominates the mobile dunes, amidst considerable areas of blown sand. Where rates of sand deposition decline, lyme grass <i>Leymus arenarius</i>, sea-holly <i>Eryngium maritimum</i> and cat’s-ear <i>Hypochaeris radicata</i> occur, with red fescue <i>Festuca rubra</i> and spreading meadow-grass <i>Poa humilis</i> present on the more sheltered ridges. Sea spurge <i>Euphorbia paralias</i> and the nationally scarce dune fescue <i>Vulpia fasciculata</i> are frequent, while sea bindweed <i>Calystegia soldanella</i> is very local. Formby Point is the hinge point between two coastal sub-cells. The zone around the Point has been eroding since 1906 while areas north and south of this zone are accreting (where the nature of the coast allows).
