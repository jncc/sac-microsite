<h5>Description and ecological characteristics</h5>
<p><FONT size=2>
<P>The clear soft water which characterises this habitat type contains low to moderate levels of plant nutrients and supports a characteristic assemblage of plant species. The vegetation community is characterised by amphibious short perennial vegetation, with shoreweed <I>Littorella uniflora</I> being considered as the defining component. This species often occurs in association with water lobelia <I>Lobelia dortmanna</I>, bog pondweed <I>Potamogeton polygonifolius</I>, quillwort <I>Isoetes lacustris</I>, bulbous rush <I>Juncus bulbosus</I>, needle spike-rush <I>Eleocharis acicularis</I>, alternate water milfoil <I>Myriophyllum alterniflorum</I> and floating water bur-reed <I>Sparganium angustifolium</I>. Yellow water-lily <I>Nuphar lutea</I>, amphibious bistort <I>Persicaria amphibia</I>, stoneworts <I>Chara </I>spp., least bur-reed <I>Sparganium natans</I> and other pondweeds <I>Potamogeton</I> spp. may be present in more mesotrophic conditions. Most of these species are common components of the aquatic flora of standing waters in the mountainous regions of the north-west. <B>1831 Floating water-plantain <I>Luronium natans</B></I> and pillwort <I>Pilularia globulifera</I> are two nationally scarce plants that occur in this plant assemblage. The marginal components of this community can be exposed on the lake shores during summer. </P>
<P>This habitat type comprises both oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters, and more rarely may include intergrading types. While each supports a characteristic plant community, the dominant substrates of both oligotrophic and mesotrophic waters are silt, sand, gravel, stones and boulders. Standing waters qualifying for this habitat type in th UK are usually classified as Types 2 and 3 (oligotrophic) and Type&nbsp;5 (mesotrophic) of the Standing Waters Classification (Palmer 1992).</P></FONT></p>

<h5>European status and distribution</h5>

<div class="small-12">Llyn Cwellyn, north Wales, is an oligotrophic glacial lake (Type&nbsp;3) representative of oligotrophic lakes found in the mountains of Snowdonia. It is a relatively large, deep lake, in contrast to Llyn Idwal, also in Snowdonia. Because of its depth the lake stratifies during the summer, with a thermocline developing at 10-15&nbsp;m depth that has a marked effect upon the ecology of the site. Although the site has acidified since the late 19<SUP><FONT size=2>th</SUP></FONT> century, water quality remains high and Llyn Cwellyn supports one of the few native Welsh populations of Arctic charr <I>Salvelinus alpinus</I> (‘Torgoch’ in Welsh). The macrophyte flora of Llyn Cwellyn is characterised by abundant shoreweed <I>Littorella uniflora</I>, water lobelia <I>Lobelia dortmanna</I>, quillwort <I>Isoetes lacustris</I>, bulbous rush <I>Juncus bulbosus</I> and alternate water-milfoil <I>Myriophyllum alterniflorum</I>. The rare awlwort <I>Subularia aquatica</I> is abundant in places and <B>1831 Floating water-plantain <I>Luronium natans</I></B> occurs at this site. Six-stamened waterwort <I>Elatine hexandra</I> has been recorded in shallow water off the north shore and bog pondweed <I>Potamogeton polygonifolius</I> occurs in stream inflows in the south.</div></div>

    <div class="small-6"><b>Highlands and Islands</b></div>
<div class="small-12">This mountain massif in the north-west Highlands of Scotland includes a number of small oligotrophic lochs, some of these at relatively high altitude. The massif has a wide variety of landforms created by glacial activity and a diversity of rock types leading to a range of plant communities within the lochs. Notably, several of the lochs support the rare awlwort <i>Subularia aquatica</i>, a plant indicative of oligotrophic water.</div></div>

<div class="small-12">The principal freshwater loch on Ben Lawers in the central Highlands is Loch nan Cat, which is representative of <b>oligotrophic standing waters</b> and drains a calcareous schist catchment, a rare type in Britain. The loch is at high altitude (710 m), has a variety of substrates, is of very low nutrient status (Type 3) and supports a relatively diverse flora, including quillwort <i>Isoetes lacustris</i>, which is indicative of this oligotrophic freshwater habitat type. In addition, the flora includes several pondweed <i>Potamogeton</i> spp. and delicate stonewort <i>Chara virgata</i>.</div></div>

    <div class="small-6"><b>West Wales and The Valleys</b></div>
<div class="small-12">Within the Cadair Idris range, Llyn Cau is a mountain lake representative of this type, located in an upland cirque. The lake’s conical basin, which reaches a water depth of almost 50&nbsp;m, results from glacial scour of Ordovician volcanic and sedimentary rocks. Quillwort <I>Isoetes lacustris</I> is abundant and shoreweed <I>Littorella uniflora</I> occurs frequently. The boulder-dominated shore has abundant growths of liverworts and mosses, including <I>Sphagnum denticulatum</I> and <I>Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus</I>. There are distinct associations of <I>I. lacustris</I>, starwort <I>Callitriche hamulata</I> and bulbous rush <I>Juncus bulbosus</I> var. <I>fluitans</I>, the latter being most abundant adjacent to inflow streams. The water is moderately acid with low conductivity but relatively high nitrate concentrations for an upland lake. A lake sediment study did not reveal any evidence of acidification. It has been classified as a type&nbsp;1 (dystrophic lake) on the basis of its vegetation but its water transparency is very high with a distinctive blue colour. It stratifies with a thermocline at 10-15&nbsp;m depth. Brown trout <I>Salmo trutta fario</I> are present.</div></div>

    <div class="small-6"><b>Highlands and Islands, North Eastern Scotland</b></div>
<div class="small-12">The Cairngorm mountains contain the highest oligotrophic waterbodies in the UK. This complex of lochs has a range of high altitude conditions. The very highest waters (corrie and plateau lochs at >900 m) have rocky substrates and very low nutrient status, and suffer the harshest climate. In combination, these factors lead to low species diversity and the absence of aquatic macrophytes. This is an extreme variation of the habitat type. Lochs in the valley floors enjoy more sheltered conditions and the occurrence of finer sediments allows limited establishment of higher plants, although these are still extremely oligotrophic systems. Key species for this habitat type are present in Loch Einich (altitude 500 m), which supports quillwort <i>Isoetes lacustris</i> and shoreweed <i>Littorella uniflora</i>. The rare six-stamened waterwort <i>Elatine hexandra</i> has also been recorded here. The lochs in this area are classified as Type 3 or in some cases Type 2.</div></div>

<div class="small-12">Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands supports a range of high-quality freshwater loch habitats that include <b>Oligotrophic to mesotrophic standing waters</b>. The lochs are part of large, generally nutrient-poor, drainage systems which characterise this part of the northern Highlands. The site covers an area greater than 140,000 ha and includes several hundred freshwater lochs of which the larger are oligotrophic. The lochs are generally located within <b>7130 blanket bog</b> and peatlands that sit on nutrient-poor rocks. The aquatic vegetation is dominated by a very narrow range of species typical of northern, upland, lochs but there is much local variation in their abundance. The most characteristic species are shoreweed <i>Littorella uniflora</i>, water lobelia <i>Lobelia dortmanna</i>, bulbous rush <i>Juncus bulbosus</i>, bog pondweed <i>Potamogeton polygonifolius</i> and alternate water-milfoil <i>Myriophyllum alterniflorum</i>. More mesotrophic lochs support a wider range of pondweed <i>Potamogeton</i> species; other species present include stoneworts <i>Chara</i> spp. and <i>Nitella</i> spp. and least bur-reed <i>Sparganium natans</i>. The margins of a few lochs support two nationally scarce plants; bog hair-grass <i>Deschampsia setacea</i> and marsh clubmoss <i>Lycopodiella inundata</i>. Other notable species include awlwort <i>Subularia aquatica</i> and water sedge <i>Carex aquatilis</i>.

    <div class="small-6"><b>Eastern Scotland</b></div>
<div class="small-12">This site, comprising five lochs along the Lunan Burn on the northern edge of the central Scottish lowlands, provides a natural example of gradually-increasing eutophy. The three upper lochs (Craiglush, Lowes and Butterstone) lie north of the Highland Boundary Fault with catchments which are predominantly upland and acidic; the lower lochs (Clunie and Marlee) lie south of the Fault with predominantly agricultural and more enriched catchments. The series provides examples of relatively unpolluted oligotrophic to mesotrophic loch types, which are rare and decreasing habitats in Britain, especially in the lowlands. The aquatic flora is exceptionally diverse, with the number of pondweeds <i>Potamogeton</i> spp. at Loch of the Lowes and Loch Clunie being outstanding. <b>1833 slender naiad <i>Najas flexilis</i></b> occurs in each of the lochs. The site also contains a very large number of plant species, including many of local or national rarity, and is notable for the extensive area of poor-fen.</div></div>

    <div class="small-6"><b>Highlands and Islands</b></div>
<div class="small-12">Loch Ussie in the north-east Highlands lies in a shallow basin of Old Red Sandstone rocks and is one of the best mesotrophic lochs in Scotland. The distribution of natural mesotrophic lochs in Scotland is restricted, occurring most commonly at the junction of upland and lowland areas where the geochemical characteristics of these areas are manifested in the one waterbody. This gives rise to water quality conditions which allows the flora and fauna of upland and lowland areas to thrive. Water quality data show that Loch Ussie has a neutral pH and is moderately rich in nutrients, and a comparison with historical conditions show that it has changed little in the last 100 years. The assemblage of water plants is very diverse with nine pondweed <i>Potamogeton</i> species present, including the rare Shetland pondweed <i>Potamogeton rutilus</i>. The fringing sedge beds and shore support such species as bladder-sedge <i>Carex vesicaria</i> and pillwort <i>Pilularia globulifera</i>.</div></div>

<div class="small-12">Lough Melvin is a large mesotrophic lough that represents <b>oligotrophic to mesotrophic standing waters</b> in Northern Ireland. The north-east corner of the lough is in Fermanagh but the majority lies in Leitrim in the Republic of Ireland. It is the least-disturbed of the large loughs of Northern Ireland, the other sites having suffered from eutrophication and hydrological manipulation. The macrophyte flora is typical of a mesotrophic lake with affinities to oligotrophic waters. The flora is indicative of high water quality and is characterised by quillwort <i>Isoetes lacustris</i>, shoreweed <i>Littorella uniflora</i>, water lobelia <i>Lobelia dortmanna</i>, alternate water-milfoil <i>Myriophyllum alterniflorum</i> and a variety of pondweeds, including various-leaved pondweed <i>Potamogeton gramineus</i>, perfoliate pondweed <i>P. perfoliatus</i> and bright-leaved pondweed <i>P</i>. x <i>nitens</i>, which are widespread.

<div class="small-12">This site in the Dee valley, Grampian, Scotland includes two lochs, Kinord and Davan, in a complex area of morainic landforms and granite hills that supports a wide variety of habitats. Lochs Kinord and Davan represent high quality oligotrophic to mesotrophic freshwater habitats, and a rich aquatic flora. This includes species such as shoreweed <i>Littorella uniflora</i>, quillwort <i>Isoetes lacustris</i> and water lobelia <i>Lobelia dortmanna</i>, along with the white water-lily <i>Nymphaea alba</i>. Various pondweeds <i>Potamogeton</i> spp. are also present. In transitions from open water, the lochs also support a wide range of swamp and fen communities, dominated by common club-rush <i>Scirpus lacustris</i>, common reed <i>Phragmites australis</i> or bottle sedge <i>Carex rostrata</i>. Bog myrtle <i>Myrica gale</i> is a prominent feature of much of the adjacent fen. Fen carr characterised by willows <i>Salix</i> spp. is also present, along with other woodland habitats.</div></div>

    <div class="small-6"><b>Eastern Scotland, Highlands and Islands</b></div>
<div class="small-12">Rannoch Moor contains the most extensive complex of western blanket and soligenous/valley mire in Britain and supports a range of nutrient-poor freshwater habitats from dystrophic to oligotrophic waterbodies. The waterbodies vary in size from small lochans to relatively large lochs such as Loch Bà and Loch Laidon. Many of the small lochans have a predominantly peaty substrate resulting in a very low nutrient status, and consequently low species diversity. However the larger lochs support vegetation typical of <b>oligotrophic to mesotrophic standing waters</b> including water lobelia <i>Lobelia dortmanna</i> and bulbous rush <i>Juncus bulbosus</i>. In addition the site supports other uncommon species including least water-lily <i>Nuphar pumila</i> and floating bur-reed <i>Sparganium angustifolium</i>.</div></div>

    <div class="small-6"><b>Cumbria</b></div>
<div class="small-12">Bassenthwaite Lake in the Lake District, north-west England, is an example of a mesotrophic waterbody (Type 5), an unusual type in mountain areas. It is a large lake with an extensive catchment area and consequently is subject to rapid through-flow of water and moderate nutrient status. A wide variety of pondweeds <i>Potamogeton</i> spp. are found, including perfoliate pondweed <i>Potamogeton perfoliatus</i>, small pondweed <i>P. berchtoldii</i> and curled pondweed <i>P. crispus</i>, which are widespread, whilst red pondweed <i>P. alpinus</i>, various-leaved pondweed <i>P. gramineus</i> and lesser pondweed <i>P. pusillus</i> are more locally distributed. Uncommon species present in the community are autumnal water-starwort <i>Callitriche hermaphroditica</i> and six-stamened waterwort <i>Elatine hexandra</i>. The shorelines are extensive and relatively undisturbed compared with other major Cumbrian lakes. Much of the shore is of shingle or gravel, but soft peat has accumulated around Bowness Bay. Several sedge species are found in such areas, including a local northern species, water sedge <i>Carex aquatilis</i>. On stony shores common spike-rush <i>Eleocharis palustris</i> is locally abundant amongst species such as globeflower <i>Trollius europaeus</i>, saw-wort <i>Serratula tinctoria</i> and the nationally rare thread rush <i>Juncus filiformis</i>. The lake also supports one of only two surviving UK populations of a rare fish, vendace <i>Coregonus albula</i>. Now extinct in Scotland, the only other known surviving population of vendace is found in Derwent Water, also in the Lake District.</div></div>

    <div class="small-6"><b>Cumbria, North Yorkshire, Northumberland and Tyne and Wear</b></div>
<div class="small-12">Ullswater, in the catchment of the River Eden, is the second-largest of the Cumbrian lakes. It is chosen as an example of a relatively deep lake with both oligotrophic and mesotrophic elements in its fauna and flora. The south-western part of the lake is surrounded by high fells of the Borrowdale Volcanics with enclosed farmland confined to the valley bottoms. The north-eastern arm is in gentler terrain with deeper soils and a greater extent of enclosed farmland. The lake flows into the River Eamont, one of the major tributaries of the River Eden. The lake has an extremely rich aquatic flora, including eight species of <i>Potamogeton</i>. These include various-leaved pondweed <i>P. gramineus</i>, red pondweed <i>P. alpinus</i> and long-stalked pondweed <i>P. praelongus</i>. The nationally scarce six-stamened waterwort <i>Elatine hexandra</i> is also found in some of the bays. Ullswater supports one of the few populations of powan <i>Coregonus lavaretus</i> in the UK. Arctic charr <i>Salvelinus alpinus</i> was formerly present but is believed to have become extinct in the 1940s, possibly because of mining pollution in spawning areas.</div></div>

<div class="small-12">This site represents oligotrophic lochs and lochans (Types 2 and 3) on peatlands in Shetland. The waterbodies are concentrated on the northern side of Ronas Hill. The lochs support vegetation typical of oligotrophic habitat including water lobelia <i>Lobelia dortmanna</i>, quillwort <i>Isoetes lacustris</i>, bulbous rush <i>Juncus bulbosus</i> and shoreweed <i>Littorella uniflora</i>. Many of the lochs also support the scarce spring quillwort <i>Isoetes echinospora</i>. Several of the lochs contain small holms that support important relicts of Shetland’s tree and scrub habitat. In addition the site supports one of the densest aggregations of breeding red-throated divers <i>Gavia stellata</i> in the UK and important aquatic invertebrate populations including the arctic water-flea <i>Eurycercus glacialis</i>, which occurs in the highest lochan on Ronas Hill and has been found at only one other site in Britain.</div></div>

    <div class="small-6"><b>Highlands and Islands</b></div>
<div class="small-12">The mountainous terrain of the island of Rum off the west coast of Scotland supports waterbodies typical of <b>oligotrophic to mesotrophic standing waters</b>. The lochs in this site are classified as Type 2 or 3 and can be extremely oligotrophic with a low species diversity. However, some coastal lochs exhibit a strong maritime influence and, as a consequence, support a greater diversity and abundance of macrophytes. The three major rock types on the island, Torridonian sandstone and ultrabasic and granitic igneous rocks, influence the trophic status of the lochs. The site contains several species of note including awlwort <i>Subularia aquatica</i>, floating bur-reed <i>Sparganium angustifolium</i> and common reed <i>Phragmites australis</i>. The remote location of the island and its National Nature Reserve status means that the lochs have not been subject to significant unnatural change.</div></div>

At this site, oligotrophic conditions are present within lochs that receive drainage from the acidic blacklands, hills and moors. The principal oligotrophic loch in this site is Loch Druidibeg which has a catchment that lies over Lewisian gneiss, a rock type which weathers to produce acid and nutrient-poor soils. Loch Druidibeg is a large, shallow loch that supports a flora typical of its nutrient-poor status.</div></div>

These include the two nationally scarce species coral-necklace <I>Illecebrum verticillatum</I> and yellow centaury <I>Cicendia filiformis</I>, often in association with allseed <I>Radiola linoides</I> and chaffweed <I>Anagallis minima</I>. Heavy grazing pressure is of prime importance in the maintenance of the outstanding flora of these temporary pond communities. Livestock maintain an open habitat, controlling scrub ingress, and trampling the surface. Commoners’ animals also transport seed in their hooves widely from pond to pond where suitable habitat exists. Temporary ponds occur throughout the Forest in depressions capable of holding water for part of the year. Most ponds are small (between 5-10&nbsp;m across) and, although great in number, amount to less than 10&nbsp;ha in total area.</div></div>

    <div class="small-6"><b>Cumbria</b></div>
<div class="small-12">Wast Water is a relatively large and deep example of an oligotrophic waterbody (Type 3) in the Lake District, north-west England. Except for a small portion on Eskdale granite, Wast Water lies entirely on Borrowdale Volcanics rocks, and rocky substrates predominate along 73% of its shoreline. The submerged macrophyte communities of Wast Water are typical of oligotrophic lakes. Species such as bulbous rush <i>Juncus bulbosus</i>, quillwort <i>Isoetes lacustris</i>, shoreweed <i>Littorella uniflora</i>, awlwort <i>Subularia aquatica</i> and stoneworts <i>Nitella</i> spp. are known to occur. Least bur-reed <i>Sparganium natans</i> and floating bur-reed <i>Sparganium angustifolium</i> occur in more sheltered bays and are more typical of mesotrophic situations. Blunt-leaved pondweed <i>Potamogeton obtusifolius</i> has been recorded and bog pondweed <i>P. polygonifolius</i> occurs in the stream outlets. The macro-invertebrates of Wast Water are typical, including gastropod species (wandering snail <i>Lymnaea peregra</i> and river limpet <i>Ancylus fluviatilis</i>), the leech <i>Erpobdella octoculata</i> and the triclad <i>Polycelis nigra</i>. Arctic charr <i>Salvelinus alpinus</i> occur in the lake.</div></div>
