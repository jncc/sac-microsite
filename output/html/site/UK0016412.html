        <h4>Annex I habitats that are a primary reason for selection of this site</h4>

<div>
    <p><b>3130</b> <a href=/habitat/H3130>Clear-water lakes or lochs with aquatic vegetation and poor to moderate nutrient levels</a>&nbsp; <b>Oligotrophic to mesotrophic standing waters with vegetation of the Littorelletea uniflorae and/or of the Iso&#xEB;to-Nanojuncetea</b></p>
<p>The Cairngorm mountains contain the highest oligotrophic waterbodies in the UK. This complex of lochs has a range of high altitude conditions. The very highest waters (corrie and plateau lochs at >900 m) have rocky substrates and very low nutrient status, and suffer the harshest climate. In combination, these factors lead to low species diversity and the absence of aquatic macrophytes. This is an extreme variation of the habitat type. Lochs in the valley floors enjoy more sheltered conditions and the occurrence of finer sediments allows limited establishment of higher plants, although these are still extremely oligotrophic systems. Key species for this habitat type are present in Loch Einich (altitude 500 m), which supports quillwort <i>Isoetes lacustris</i> and shoreweed <i>Littorella uniflora</i>. The rare six-stamened waterwort <i>Elatine hexandra</i> has also been recorded here. The lochs in this area are classified as Type 3 or in some cases Type 2.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>4010</b> <a href=/habitat/H4010>Wet heathland with cross-leaved heath</a>&nbsp; <b>Northern Atlantic wet heaths with Erica tetralix</b></p>
<p>The Cairngorms is representative of <b>Northern Atlantic wet heaths with <i>Erica tetralix</i></b> in north-east Scotland and has the largest extent of this habitat in this part of the UK. M16 <i>Erica tetralix</i> – <i>Sphagnum compactum</i> wet heath is the most extensive community. The site is notable for the occurrence, at high elevation, of this eastern vegetation type, more typically associated with southern lowland heaths. The more oceanic M15 <i>Scirpus cespitosus</i> – <i>Erica tetralix</i> wet heath is also present, occupying the more strongly-flushed soils. It is the presence of undisturbed lichen-rich wet heath occupying wet hollows within high-altitude, windswept <b>4060 Alpine and Boreal heaths</b> that is of particular importance. Wet heath is also developed in hollows within the upper parts of <b>91C0 Caledonian forest</b>, within blanket mire and dry heath, giving a variety of ecological transitions. The rare montane ground-beetle <i>Amara alpina</i> is associated with wet heath in the Cairngorms, feeding on seed-heads of deergrass <i>Trichophorum cespitosum</i>.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>4030</b> <a href=/habitat/H4030>Dry heaths</a>&nbsp; <b>European dry heaths</b></p>
<p>The Cairngorms has the largest extent of <b>European dry heaths</b> in the UK and is representative of the upland heaths of the cool and less oceanic north-east of Scotland. The site contains extensive examples of all the heath types characteristic of the eastern Highlands and is representative of the heathland in this area. The principal NVC types present are H12 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> heath, H18 <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> – <i>Deschampsia flexuosa</i> heath and H16 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i> heath. These communities mainly occur on acid soils and are species-poor. The main exceptions to this are areas of species-rich H10 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Erica cinerea</i> heath, developed on base and/or lime-rich soils at Inchrory. The Cairngorms holds the most extensive well-developed snow-bed forms of <i>Vaccinium</i> – <i>Deschampsia</i> heath in the SAC series. There are widespread transitions to wet heath, woodland, juniper scrub and <b>4060 Alpine and Boreal heaths</b>.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>4060</b> <a href=/habitat/H4060>Alpine and subalpine heaths</a>&nbsp; <b>Alpine and Boreal heaths</b></p>
<p>The Cairngorms is the superlative example of the relatively continental hills of the eastern Scottish Highlands. It has the full range of heath types characteristic of the area and the most extensive tracts of <b>Alpine and Boreal heaths</b> in the UK. There is the best development of eastern lichen-rich heaths, coupled with a range of snow-bed heaths that are better developed than on any other site. H13 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Cladonia arbuscula</i> heath includes a large area in which there is a co-dominance of heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> and bearberry <i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i>, an unusual kind of heath which occurs most extensively on the Cairngorms. H19 <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> – <i>Cladonia arbuscula</i> heath is dominated by mixtures of mountain crowberry <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> ssp. <i>hermaphroditum</i>, bilberry <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i>, cowberry <i>V. vitis-idaea</i> and, unusually, trailing azalea <i>Loiseleuria procumbens</i>. H20 <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> – <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> heath is also extensive, taking the habitat type up to its highest altitude in the UK. <i>Calluna</i>-rich and <i>Vaccinium</i>-rich forms of H22 <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> – <i>Rubus chamaemorus</i> heath are more extensive than on any other site, and snow-bed forms of H18 <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> – <i>Deschampsia flexuosa</i> heath are also well-developed. There is extensive development of heath on solifluction terracing. These alpine heaths give way below to alpine forms of H12 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Vaccinium myrtillus</i> heath and H16 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</i> heath; the latter community being largely restricted to north-east Scotland. There are also transitions to <b>4030 European dry heaths</b> at lower altitude, <b>5130 Juniperus communis formations</b>, <b>4010 Northern Atlantic wet heaths</b> and <b>6150 Siliceous alpine and boreal grasslands</b> and late snow-bed vegetation. This is the single most outstanding site for high-altitude acidic habitats in the UK.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>5130</b> <a href=/habitat/H5130>Juniper on heaths or calcareous grasslands</a>&nbsp; <b>Juniperus communis formations on heaths or calcareous grasslands</b></p>
<p>The Cairngorms has the third-largest extent of juniper <b><i>Juniperus communis</i> formations</b> in the UK and is one of several sites representing the habitat type in north-east Scotland. The site is exceptional for the wide range of ecological situations in which juniper occurs. Creag Fhiaclach is unique in having the most natural altitudinal tree-line in the UK. At around 640 m there is mixed tree-line woodland with stunted Scots pine <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> and juniper, giving way at higher altitude to alpine juniper scrub. The alpine juniper scrub is developed extensively and often occurs in a stunted form transitional between ssp. <i>communis</i> and ssp. <i>nana</i>. On most of the site juniper occurs on acidic granite, while at Inchrory juniper occurs on both neutral and calcareous soils. Juniper also occurs at the margins and as part of the understorey of <b>91C0 Caledonian forest</b> within the site.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>6150</b> <a href=/habitat/H6150>Montane acid grasslands</a>&nbsp; <b>Siliceous alpine and boreal grasslands</b></p>
<p>The Cairngorms complex (Cairngorms, eastern Cairngorms, Northern Corries and Inchrory) has the largest tracts of <b>Siliceous alpine and boreal grasslands</b> in the UK, developed on granite and, more locally, base-poor schist up to very high altitudes (above 1000 m). The total extent is more than twice that on any other site in the UK. The full range of sub-types on acidicsoils is well developed and they are widespread. Both U10 <i>Carex bigelowii</i> – <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> moss-heath and <i>U7 Nardus stricta</i> – <i>Carex bigelowii</i> grass-heath are extensive. The U9 <i>Juncus trifidus</i> – <i>Racomitrium lanuginosum</i> rush-heath community is particularly well-developed, becoming predominant on the higher plateau, and its extent far exceeds that on any other site in the UK. The stands of U8 <i>Carex bigelowii</i> – <i>Polytrichum alpinum</i> sedge-heath are among the most extensive in the UK. The late-lie moss snow-beds (U11 <i>Polytrichum norvegicum</i> – <i>Kiaeria starkei</i> snow-bed and U12 <i>Salix herbacea</i> – <i>Racomitrium heterostichum</i> snow-bed) are the most extensive and well-developed in Britain. The U14 <i>Alchemilla alpina</i> – <i>Sibbaldia procumbens</i> dwarf-herb community is also well-represented.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>6230</b> <a href=/habitat/H6230>Species-rich grassland with mat-grass in upland areas</a>&nbsp; <b>Species-rich Nardus grasslands, on silicious substrates in mountain areas (and submountain areas in Continental Europe)</b>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:small;"> * Priority feature</span></p>
<p>The Cairngorms is representative of the most eastern forms of <B>species-rich <I>Nardus</I> grasslands</B> in the UK. Both CG10&nbsp;<I>Festuca ovina</I> – <I>Agrostis capillaris</I> – <I>Thymus praecox</I> grassland and CG11&nbsp;<I>Festuca ovina</I> – <I>Agrostis capillaris</I> – <I>Alchemilla alpina</I> grassland are well-represented through an altitudinal range of 300<FONT size=2>–</FONT>750&nbsp;m, associated with calcareous and basic schists. There are particularly extensive examples at Inchrory on calcareous schist, but the community occurs elsewhere, notably at Craig an Dail Beag and in Glen Feshie. Swards also occur on alluvial soils in the bottoms of many of the main glens. At Inchrory both northern and southern species are well represented, including species characteristic of both <B>species-rich <I>Nardus</I></B> and <B>6210 Semi-natural dry grasslands and scrubland facies on calcareous substrates</B> (<B><I>Festuco-Brometalia</I></B>). The most abundant of the southern species is common rockrose <I>Helianthemum nummularium</I>; others include burnet saxifrage <I>Pimpinella saxifraga</I> and blue fleabane <I>Erigeron acer</I>. Green-winged orchid <I>Orchis morio</I> has also been recorded. Northern species include yellow saxifrage <I>Saxifraga aizoides</I> and hair sedge <I>Carex capillaris</I>, both of which are locally abundant in flushed grasslands at Inchrory. Mountain everlasting <I>Antennaria dioica</I>, alpine meadow-rue <I>Thalictrum alpinum</I>, alpine saw-wort <I>Saussurea alpina</I> and the rare alpine milk-vetch <I>Astragalus alpinus</I> and alpine cinquefoil <I>Potentilla crantzii</I>, are also present.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>7130</b> <a href=/habitat/H7130>Blanket bog</a>&nbsp; <b>Blanket bogs (* if active bog)</b>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:small;"> * Priority feature</span></p>
<p>The Cairngorms support extensive areas of <b>blanket bog</b> both on the lower slopes, where it gives way to <b>4010 Northern Atlantic wet heath</b> and <b>4030 European dry heaths</b> as the gradient increases, and at high altitude. This contrasts with most other sites, which tend to be dominated by bogs of more limited altitudinal range. At low altitude bogs occur along valleysides and in depressions amongst the undulating glacial deposits and there are good examples of M18 <i>Erica tetralix</i> – <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i> blanket mire. Where bogs occur within or adjacent to <b>91C0 Caledonian forest</b>, Scots pine <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> is often present, forming stands of <b>91D0 Bog woodland</b>. These bogs are generally rich in the bog-mosses <i>Sphagnum capillifolium</i> and <i>S. papillosum</i>. On the Cairngorms blanket bog probably extends to a higher altitude than on any other SAC in the UK, around 1000 m. The bogs at higher altitude are M19 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> blanket mire and some of these are moderately extensive on the gently sloping plateaux below the mountain tops. Above about 850 m, heather <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> disappears from the blanket bog and is replaced by mountain crowberry <i>Empetrum nigrum</i> ssp. <i>hermaphroditum</i> and bog bilberry <i>Vaccinium uliginosum</i>. Dwarf birch <i>Betula nana</i> occurs locally in this higher-altitude bog. Lichens of the reindeer group (<i>Cladonia arbuscula</i> and <i>C. rangiferina</i>) are abundant, and the Cairngorms have some of the best examples of lichen-rich bogs.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>7220</b> <a href=/habitat/H7220>Hard-water springs depositing lime</a>&nbsp; <b>Petrifying springs with tufa formation (Cratoneurion)</b>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:small;"> * Priority feature</span></p>
<p>The Cairngorms is one of three sites representing upland <b>petrifying springs with tufa formation</b> in north-east Scotland. The springs occur particularly at Inchrory, where there is an extensive series of springs associated with metamorphosed limestones and calc-schists. There are transitions to <b>7230 Alkaline fens</b>, <b>6230 Species-rich <i>Nardus</i> grasslands</b> and more acidic grassland and heath communities.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>7240</b> <a href=/habitat/H7240>High-altitude plant communities associated with areas of water seepage</a>&nbsp; <b>Alpine pioneer formations of the Caricion bicoloris-atrofuscae</b>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:small;"> * Priority feature</span></p>
<p>The Cairngorms is one of two sites in the eastern Scottish Highlands representing <b>alpine pioneer formations</b> of lime and/or base-rich mires at moderately high altitude. Due to the predominance of acidic rocks within the Cairngorms complex this habitat is very restricted in extent, occurring mainly in the Inchrory area, associated with calcareous rocks and occurring alongside <b>7220 petrifying springs</b> and <b>7230 alkaline fen</b>. A small representation is also present in Glen Feshie. Despite this restricted distribution, these flushes are well-developed. They contain a range of characteristic species, including yellow saxifrage <i>Saxifraga aizoides</i>, Scottish asphodel <i>Tofieldia pusilla</i>, three-flowered rush <i>Juncus triglumis</i> and alpine rush <i>J. alpinoarticulatus</i>. Sheathed sedge <i>Carex vaginata</i> is also present. The main NVC type present is M11 <i>Carex demissa</i> – <i>Saxifraga aizoides</i> mire.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>8110</b> <a href=/habitat/H8110>Acidic scree</a>&nbsp; <b>Siliceous scree of the montane to snow levels (Androsacetalia alpinae and Galeopsietalia ladani)</b></p>
<p>The Cairngorms complex contains representative examples of high altitude <b>siliceous scree</b> communities characteristic of the eastern Scottish Highlands. Extensive areas of scree occur on granite at a range of altitudes in the Cairngorms. The scree communities in this site are very diverse. Of particular interest is the flora of high-altitude screes in the snowy corries, with parsley fern <i>Cryptogramma crispa</i>, alpine lady-fern <i>Athyrium distentifolium</i> and rare wavy meadow-grass <i>Poa flexuosa</i> (U18). The flora is rich in rare moss species, for example <i>Dicranum glaciale</i>, and rare liverworts, such as <i>Tetralophozia setiformis</i> and <i>Marsupella adusta</i>. These occur on rocks in and about the snow-beds. There are also several northern Atlantic bryophytes such as <i>Scapania nimbosa</i>, <i>Scapania ornithopodioides</i> and <i>Anastrophyllum donnianum</i>, which are restricted to areas of late snow-lie where they are protected from winter frosts.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>8220</b> <a href=/habitat/H8220>Plants in crevices on acid rocks</a>&nbsp; <b>Siliceous rocky slopes with chasmophytic vegetation</b></p>
<p>The Cairngorms represent high-altitude <b>Siliceous rocky slopes with chasmophytic vegetation</b> in the eastern Scottish Highlands. Crevice communities occur widely on acidic granite rocks and support an abundance of characteristic species. Rare species include Highland cudweed <i>Gnaphalium norvegicum</i>, alpine speedwell <i>Veronica alpina</i>, spiked wood-rush <i>Luzula spicata</i> and hare’s-foot sedge <i>Carex lachenalii</i>.</p></div>
<div>
    <p><b>91C0</b> <a href=/habitat/H91C0>Caledonian forest</a>&nbsp; <b>Caledonian forest</b>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:small;"> * Priority feature</span></p>
<p>The Cairngorms complex, consisting of six individually large <b>Caledonian forest</b> areas, including Abernethy and North Rothiemurchus, represents the more ‘continental’ East Central biochemical region, typically with W18b <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> – <i>Hylocomium splendens</i> woodland, <i>Vaccinium</i> spp. sub-community. This complex of woodlands is the most extensive area of native pinewood in the UK and comprises almost half the total area of ancient <b>Caledonian forest</b> in Scotland. In common with the rest of Scotland, the upper limits of the pine woodland are mostly artificially depressed by grazing, but a more natural tree-line occurs at 640 m on Creag Fhiachlach. This is the highest altitudinal limit of woodland in the UK, and consists of bushy stunted growth of Scots pine <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> admixed with juniper <i>Juniperus communis</i> of a similar stature. The pine woodland shows transitions to a wide range of other vegetation, including <b>91D0 Bog woodland</b> on the forest mires. There are areas of unusual herb-rich pine woodland at Mar Lodge, similar to those described at Ballochbuie. This type of forest is of very restricted distribution in Scotland. The forest contains nationally important populations of capercaillie <i>Tetrao urogallus</i>, Scottish crossbill <i>Loxia scotica</i> and the osprey <i>Pandion haliaetus</i>.</p></div>

<p>This site contains one of the largest areas of native <b>91C0 Caledonian forest</b> in the UK, lying on gently-undulating glacial deposits in the foothills of the Cairngorms. Scots pine <i>Pinus sylvestris</i> <b>Bog woodland</b> has developed within the forest because the irregular glacial topography has led to marked variations in geomorphology and drainage pattern. The drier slopes and knolls support mature pine woodland and in the hollows between, wet mires with abundant bog woodland have developed. These stands are composed of mire vegetation, either M18 <i>Erica tetralix</i> – <i>Sphagnum papillosum</i> mire or M19 <i>Calluna vulgaris</i> – <i>Eriophorum vaginatum</i> mire, with a scattering of stunted pine trees and saplings. A good intact example of this community occurs at Mineral Well within Rothiemurchus forest. Recent peat stratigraphy shows evidence of a history of wooded bog on this site. The bog woodland appears to be stable, and the trees, although stunted, continue to grow. Other areas, including Inshriach, have been influenced by past management for commercial forestry, and recent restoration work has created the conditions required for wet woodland restoration. In total the hollows form an extensive area representing the largest example of <b>Bog woodland</b> in Scotland.</p></div>        <h4>Annex I habitats present as a qualifying feature, but not a primary reason for selection of this site</h4>

<p>Green shield-moss <I>Buxbaumia viridis</I><I>B. viridis</I></B> at Rothiemurchus had sporophytes, four in total and much fewer than in 2002. However, three new stands, close together, were found at Abernethy with a total of eight sporophytes. Areas of woodland with apparently suitable habitat were found to be very patchy, but a number of areas with good potential habitat were identified. It is thought possible that further survey may result in more new records for the species. Although sporophyte production is small, it is broadly comparable with that at the site at Moniack Gorge, Highland,&nbsp;and greater than that at Kindrogan, Perthshire. Given the extant records and the potential for discovery of further stands, the Cairngorms area is probably the most important locus for the species in the UK. </p></div>        <h4>Annex II species present as a qualifying feature, but not a primary reason for site selection</h4>
