      "FeatureDescription": "\r\n<P>The <B>freshwater pearl mussel <I>Margaritifera margaritifera</B></I> grows to 140 mm in length, and burrows into sandy substrates, often between boulders and pebbles, in fast-flowing rivers and streams. It requires cool, well-oxygenated soft water free of pollution or turbidity. The mussel spends its larval, or glochidial, stage attached to the gills of salmonid fishes. The larvae attach themselves during mid to late summer and drop off the following spring to settle in the riverbed gravel where they grow to adulthood.</P>\r\n<P>Population declines have been caused by factors such as pearl-fishing, pollution, acidification, organic enrichment, siltation, river engineering, and declining salmonid stocks. An additional serious threat in parts of mainland Europe is predation by introduced muskrat <I>Ondatra zibethicus</I> (Zahner-Meike &amp; Hanson 2001). <B><I>M. margaritifera</B></I> is now a rare species whose conservation is giving rise to concern, and its increasing rarity in mainland Europe gives extra significance to UK populations.</P>\r\n<P>As this species does not reach reproductive maturity until at least 12 years old and may live for over 120 years (Bauer 1992; Beasley &amp; Roberts 1999), population age-structure is vitally important when assessing viability. The presence of juveniles (a feature essential to the long-term sustainability of mussel populations) is a clear indicator of the structural and functional features of the habitat required for the survival and reproduction of the species. </P>",
      "EUStatus": "\r\n<P>The <B>freshwater pearl mussel <I>Margaritifera margaritifera</B></I> is widely distributed in Europe, Fennoscandia and north-eastern North America, but has suffered serious decline and is threatened with extinction or is highly vulnerable in every part of its former range. It is listed as ‘vulnerable’ by IUCN, but is believed to be even more threatened. Outside Britain and Ireland, recruiting populations of international importance survive in probably fewer than 50 rivers world-wide (Young <I>et al</I>. 2001). Only a few viable populations survive in mainland Europe, most remaining continental populations consisting of mussels at least 30 years old with few signs of recent recruitment – although an apparent absence of juveniles may in some cases be partly due to difficulties in surveying (Hastie &amp; Cosgrove 2002). A distinct hard-water form, <I>M. margaritifera durrovensis</I>, is restricted to a few river systems in southern Ireland. </P>",
      "UKStatus": "<B><I>\r\n<P>Margaritifera margaritifera</B></I> was formerly widespread throughout western and northern parts of Great Britain. However, England and Wales are each now believed to support only a single recruiting population. In Northern Ireland the species formerly occurred widely in several catchments, but is now restricted to a few sites. Many UK rivers now contain only scattered individuals, with no juvenile mussels recorded; such populations may become extinct due to lack of recruitment. Despite serious declines in both range and total population, Scotland is the remaining European stronghold for <B><I>M. margaritifera</B></I>, supporting functional populations in over 50 rivers, mainly in the Highlands. </P>",
      "Rationale": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The selection of sites for freshwater pearl mussel has been influenced by the importance of the UK for conserving this species in Europe. Site selection has been based on an analysis of past records and more recent survey of potentially important rivers. Most of the selected sites hold large populations which contain juvenile mussels (indicating the presence of functional populations). Consideration has been given to the geographical distribution of the species; the predominance of Scottish rivers reflects the presence of more large viable populations here than in other parts of the UK. </P>\r\n<P>While the SAC series makes a contribution to securing favourable conservation status for this Annex II species, wider measures, including implementation of the </FONT><A href=\"http://www.ukbap.org.uk/asp/UKPlans.asp?UKListID=437\">Species Action Plan</A><FONT size=2>, are also necessary to support its conservation in the UK.</P></FONT>",

      "FeatureDescription": "\r\n<P>The <B>marsh fritillary butterfly <I>Euphydryas</I> <I>aurinia</B></I> is found in a range of habitats in which its larval food plant, devil’s-bit scabious <I>Succisa pratensis</I>, occurs. Marsh fritillaries are essentially grassland butterflies in the UK, and although populations may occur occasionally on wet heath, bog margins and woodland clearings, most colonies are found in damp acidic or dry calcareous grasslands (including <B>6410</B> <B><I>Molinia</I> meadows on calcareous, peaty or clayey-silt-laden soils (<I>Molinion caeruleae</I>)</B> and <B>6210</B> <B>Semi-natural dry grasslands and scrubland facies on calcareous substrates (<I>Festuco-Brometalia</I>)</B>). In Northern Ireland it occurs in fens and on sand dunes. Management in both wet and dry situations is predominantly by low-intensity cattle or pony grazing. Sheep selectively graze devil’s-bit scabious and are therefore detrimental to marsh fritillary populations, except at very low stocking rates. Burning and mowing are also known to have caused the extinction of populations.</P>\r\n<P>Populations of marsh fritillary vary greatly in size from year to year, and, at least in part, this is related to cycles of attack from parasitic wasps. Adults tend to be sedentary and remain in a series of linked metapopulations, forming numerous temporary sub-populations, which frequently die out and recolonise. Where unable to do this, populations do not seem to be able to persist in habitat fragments. It is therefore essential to conserve a cluster of sites in close proximity.</P>\r\n<P>The sedentary behaviour of the adults and increasing fragmentation of their preferred habitats has led to the establishment of local races. The marsh fritillary is an extremely variable butterfly, with 34 subspecies described from Europe alone. Populations of this species found in Argyll and the Inner Hebrides are regarded as a distinct form <I>Euphydryas aurinia scotica</I>.</P>",
      "EUStatus": "<B><I>\r\n<P>Euphydryas</I> <I>aurinia</B></I> has declined dramatically in Europe and is regarded as endangered or vulnerable in most of its European range. On the basis of existing knowledge, the UK and Spain constitute the European strongholds for this species. </P>",
      "UKStatus": "\r\n<P>Although formerly widespread in central and eastern England, <B><I>Euphydryas aurinia</B></I> is now mainly confined to western and northern parts of the UK. It has become extinct over a large part of its former range, having declined by about 60% since records began. The species continues to be vulnerable in many parts of its range. Important centres of distribution are in south-west England (particularly Devon, Dorset and Wiltshire), south and west Wales, and western Scotland.</P>",
      "Rationale": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>Site selection has been influenced by the importance of UK marsh fritillary populations in a European context. Sites have been selected to take account of the diversity of ecological situations in which the species occurs, including wet and dry grassland, heathland, fens and sand dunes. The selected sites represent the broad geographical distribution of marsh fritillary in the UK, and include Scottish sites which hold distinctive forms of the species. The dependency of closely-related metapopulations has been taken into account, and so the SAC series includes the larger and more complex sites where the species occurs.</P>\r\n<P>While the SAC series makes a contribution to securing favourable conservation status for this Annex II species, wider measures are also necessary to support its conservation in the UK, including implementation of the </FONT><A href=\"http://www.ukbap.org.uk/asp/UKPlans.asp?UKListID=300\">Species Action Plan</A><FONT size=2>.</P></FONT>",

Soon after this, crayfish plague (a virulent disease caused by the fungus <I>Aphanomyces astaci</I>) broke out and spread rapidly, causing drastic losses of native crayfish in rivers in England. It is believed that this disease was introduced and is spread by the most frequently farmed species, the North American signal crayfish <A href=\"http://www.searchnbn.net/searchengine/search.jsp?searchTerm=%22Pacifastacus+leniusculus%22\"><I>Pacifastacus leniusculus</I></A>, a carrier of the disease. Crayfish plague can be introduced into a waterbody not only by entry of signal crayfish but also by water, fish or equipment that has been in contact with signals. This greatly increases the risk to remaining white-clawed crayfish populations.</P>\r\n<P>Signal and other non-native crayfish are larger and more aggressive than the native species and are able to produce more young. Consequently, the introduced species pose a threat not only because some are disease-carriers, but also through predation and competition with white-clawed crayfish. In Britain, signal crayfish are now well-established in the wild. In Northern Ireland no crayfish farms have been established and crayfish plague is unknown, although it occurs in the Republic of Ireland (Holdich &amp; Reeve 1991; Holdich &amp; Rogers 1997). It is only in areas free of disease that white-clawed crayfish are likely to survive in the future.</P>",

Both fish have streamlined bodies covered with distinct, large, circular scales which form a toothed edge on the lower margin and an adipose membrane which partially covers each eye. Measuring 30-50 cm, allis shad are usually larger than twaite shad, which rarely exceed 40 cm. However, the only reliable way of separating the two species is to examine the gills – allis shad have 90-130 gill-rakers (comb-like structures that are used to filter zooplankton) on the first gill arch, whereas twaite shad have only 40-60. </P>\r\n<P>Relatively little information is available on the habitat requirements of allis shad in freshwater. It grows in coastal waters and estuaries but migrates into rivers to spawn, swimming up to 800 km upstream in continental Europe. However, allis shad do not readily traverse obstacles to migration such as dams or weirs, and this has been a major cause of their decline. Adults spawn at night with a great deal of noisy splashing; the eggs are released into the current where they settle among gaps in gravelly substrates. Spawning sites tend to be used year after year, and relatively shallow gravelly areas adjacent to deep pools are thought to represent optimal spawning habitat.

Both fish have streamlined bodies covered with distinct, large, circular scales which form a toothed edge on the lower margin and an adipose membrane which partially covers each eye. Rarely exceeding 40 cm length, twaite shad are usually smaller than allis shad, which measure 30-50 cm. However, the only reliable way of separating the two species is to examine the gills – twaite shad have only 40-60 gill-rakers (comb-like structures that are used to filter zooplankton) on the first gill arch, whereas allis shad have 90-130. </P>\r\n<P>This species returns from the sea to spawn in spring, usually between April and June, hence the alternative name of ‘May fish’. The habitat requirements of twaite shad are not fully understood. On the River Usk and the River Wye, twaite shad are known to spawn at night in a shallow area near deeper pools, in which the fish congregate. The eggs are released into the water column, sinking into the interstices between coarse gravel/cobble substrates. The majority of adults die after spawning, though UK populations appear to have an unusually high proportion of repeat spawners – up to 25%. After hatching the fry develop and slowly drift downstream. Recruitment seems to be highest in warm years, and high flows between May and August may result in fry being washed prematurely out to sea. </P>\r\n<P>Population declines in many parts of Europe have been attributed to pollution, overfishing and migratory route obstructions.</P>",

      "FeatureDescription": "\r\n<P>The <B>Atlantic salmon <I>Salmo salar</B></I> is an anadromous species (i.e. adults migrate from the sea to breed in freshwater). Spawning takes place in shallow excavations called redds, found in shallow gravelly areas in clean rivers and streams where the water flows swiftly. The young that emerge spread out into other parts of the river. After a period of 1-6 years the young salmon migrate downstream to the sea as ‘smolts’. Salmon have a homing instinct that draws them back to spawn in the river of their birth after 1-3 years in the sea. This behaviour has resulted in genetically distinct stock between rivers and even within individual rivers, with some evidence of further genetic distinctiveness in the tributaries of large rivers. </P>\r\n<P>Salmon rivers vary considerably in their ecological and hydrological characteristics and in the life-cycle strategies adopted by the salmon within them. There are particularly strong contrasts between southern and northern rivers, and the UK’s varied climate, geology and terrain means that high diversity can be found within some of the large rivers. The cool and wet climate in the north, often with harder, more resistant rocks and steeper slopes, results in salmon rivers that are sparsely vegetated, nutrient-poor and prone to sudden increases in flow (‘spates’) in response to heavy downfalls or sudden snow-melt. As a result, salmon may take several years to reach the smolt stage and migrate to sea. In the south, rivers flow across gentler terrain and softer rocks, in a warmer, drier climate. Here, salmon often grow sufficiently quickly to smolt as yearlings. </P>\r\n<P>The species is subject to many pressures in Europe, including pollution, the introduction of non-native salmon stocks, physical barriers to migration, exploitation from netting and angling, physical degradation of spawning and nursery habitat, and increased marine mortality. </P>",

It is likely that the enlightened policy of catch and release which operates on the river has been significant in protecting it from the worst effects of the problems affecting many other rivers throughout the region. The stock of adult salmon in the Little Gruinard is dominated by grilse which return to the river having spent one winter at sea, although smaller numbers of adults which have spent two winters at sea also return to the river in the late spring and summer.

The Tweed is the best example in Britain of a large river showing a strong nutrient gradient along its length, with oligotrophic conditions in its headwaters, and nutrient-rich lowland conditions just before it enters the sea at Berwick. The high proportion of the River Tweed accessible to salmon, and the variety of habitat conditions in the river, has resulted in the Scottish section of the river supporting the full range of salmon life-history types, with sub-populations of spring, summer salmon and grilse all being present.\rThe extensive system supports a significant proportion of the Scottish salmon resource. In recent years, the salmon catch in the River Tweed is the highest in Scotland, with up to 15% of all salmon caught. Considerable work has been done by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (and previously the Tweed River Purification Board) and the River Tweed Foundation in tackling pollution and easing the passage of salmon past artificial barriers in the river. This has reversed many of the river’s historical problems with water quality and access for salmon.",

It is also one of the most diverse river systems in the UK, with a transition from hard geology, high gradients, rapid flow fluctuations and low nutrient-content in its upper reaches, to a more nutrient-rich river with lower gradient, more stable flow and softer geology in the lowlands. The effect of river engineering work on migration and spawning has been limited, although there is a localised influence from the Elan Valley reservoirs, through inundation of spawning and nursery habitat and fluctuations in flow and water levels in the upper Wye. The most important tributaries for spawning are included in the SAC. Although in the past non-native salmon may have been released to the system, the impact of this is likely to have been minimal. The Wye salmon population is particularly notable for the very high proportion (around 75%) of multi sea winter (MSW) fish, a stock component which has declined sharply in recent years throughout the UK. This pattern has also occurred in the Wye, with a consequent marked decline in the population since the 1980s. However, the Wye salmon population is still of considerable importance in UK terms.",

      "FeatureDescription": "\r\n<P>The <B>great crested newt <I>Triturus cristatus</B></I> is the largest native British newt, reaching up to around 17 cm length. It has a granular skin texture (caused by glands which contain toxins making it unpalatable to predators), and in the terrestrial phase is dark grey, brown or black over most of the body, with a bright yellow/orange and black belly pattern. Adult males have jagged crests running along the body and tail. Newts require aquatic habitats for breeding. Eggs are laid singly on pond vegetation in spring, and larvae develop over summer to emerge in August – October, normally taking 2–4 years to reach maturity. Juveniles spend most time on land, and all terrestrial phases may range a considerable distance from breeding sites. </P>\r\n<P>Breeding sites are mainly medium-sized ponds, though ditches and other waterbody types may also be used less frequently. Ponds with ample aquatic vegetation (which is used for egg-laying) seem to be favoured. Great crested newts do not require very high water quality, but are normally found in ponds with a circum-neutral pH. Broad habitat type varies greatly, the most frequent being pastoral and arable farmland, woodland, scrub, and grassland. There are also populations in coastal dunes and shingle structures. Great crested newts can be found in rural, urban and post-industrial settings, with populations less able to thrive where there are high degrees of fragmentation. The connectivity of the landscape is important, since great crested newts often occur in metapopulations that encompass a cluster of several or many ponds. This helps ensure the survival of populations even if sub-populations are affected by, for example, pond desiccation or fish introductions. Climate may influence the range edge at the north of its distribution in Scotland, but other ecological or landscape factors such as pond density are probably more important in determining distribution across the main part of its British range.</P>",
      "EUStatus": "\r\n<P>The <B>great crested newt <I>Triturus cristatus</B></I> is found widely throughout northern Europe. Populations are thought to have declined dramatically throughout the species’ European range.</P>",
      "UKStatus": "\r\n<P>The <B>great crested newt <I>Triturus cristatus</B></I> is widespread throughout much of England and Wales, but occurs only sparsely in south-west England, mid Wales and Scotland. It is absent from Northern Ireland. The total UK population is relatively large and is distributed over sites that vary greatly in their ecological character. One estimate has put the national population at around 400,000 animals in 18,000 breeding sites. Many of the largest populations are centred on disused mineral-extraction sites, but lowland farmland forms the majority of great crested newt habitat in the UK.</P>",
      "Rationale": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>Sites have been selected where there is evidence of a relatively large and robust population of <B>great crested newts <I>Triturus cristatus</B></I> based on reliable recent survey data. Sites which either lack reliable population estimates or support small populations have not been selected. The SAC series represents the wide range of habitat types used by the species, and includes representative sites in semi-natural and more anthropogenic settings, as well as taking into account different vegetation and geology types. The selected sites include ponds in pastoral and arable farmland, woodland, grassland, coastal habitats, and disused mineral-extraction sites. Geographical representation of different areas within the species’ range has also been taken into account.</P>\r\n<P>While the SAC series makes a contribution to securing favourable conservation status for this Annex II species, wider measures are also necessary to support its conservation in the UK, including those identified under the </FONT><A href=\"http://www.ukbap.org.uk/asp/UKPlans.asp?UKListID=619\">UK Biodiversity Action Plan</A><FONT size=2>, such as pond creation and management.</P></FONT>",

During the summer they form maternity colonies in old buildings and emerge to hunt in nearby woodland. The species prefers sheltered valleys with extensive deciduous woods or dense scrub, close to roost sites. Where habitat is fragmented, linear features such as hedgerows are important corridors between roosts and foraging areas. Ideally, roost sites offer a range of temperature conditions in different parts of a single site, allowing the bats to change location; otherwise breeding females are likely to change site during the summer. In winter they hibernate in caves, mines and other cave-like places. Summer and winter roosts are usually less than 5-10 km apart. The bats are vulnerable to the loss or disturbance of both summer and winter roost sites and the removal of linear habitat corridors.</P>",
      "EUStatus": "\r\n<P>The <B>lesser horseshoe bat <I>Rhinolophus hipposideros</B></I> is a widespread but rare species in central and southern Europe, extending as far eastwards as the Middle East. It has suffered widespread population declines, especially in the more northern parts of its range. The UK supports one of the largest populations of this species in western Europe. </P>",

Until the early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, the species benefited from abandoned mine workings, but the sealing of old mines is likely to have reduced the population and range. Recent monitoring suggests that populations are increasing, particularly in Wales, with increased densities in wooded areas. </P>",

During the summer, they form maternity colonies, generally in large old buildings, and forage in pasture, edges of mixed deciduous woodland and hedgerows. Such mixed land-use, especially on south-facing slopes, favours the beetles, moths and other insects on which the bats feed. In winter they depend on caves, abandoned mines and other underground sites for undisturbed hibernation. A system or series of sites is required, offering a range of temperatures and air-flow patterns. Summer and winter roosts are usually less than 20-30 km apart. The bats are vulnerable to the loss of insect food supplies due to insecticide use, changing farming practices and the loss of broad-leaved tree-cover, and to the loss or disturbance of underground roost sites. </P>",

The total UK population of approximately 4,000 individuals can be divided into about twelve discrete populations, based on maternity (summer) roosts and their associated hibernation sites (hibernacula) (Mitchell-Jones 1995). Populations range in size from about 80 to 600 breeding females and there is relatively little interchange between populations. Until the early 20<SUP>th</SUP> century, the species occurred as far east as Kent, and the bats benefited from abandoned mine workings, but the sealing of old mines is likely to have seriously reduced its population.</P>",

      "FeatureDescription": "\r\n<P>The <B>otter <I>Lutra lutra</B></I> is a semi-aquatic mammal, which occurs in a wide range of ecological conditions, including inland freshwater and coastal areas (particularly in Scotland). Populations in coastal areas utilise shallow, inshore marine areas for feeding but also require fresh water for bathing and terrestrial areas for resting and breeding holts. Coastal otter habitat ranges from sheltered wooded inlets to more open, low-lying coasts. Inland populations utilise a range of running and standing freshwaters. These must have an abundant supply of food (normally associated with high water quality), together with suitable habitat, such as vegetated river banks, islands, reedbeds and woodland, which are used for foraging, breeding and resting. </P>",
      "EUStatus": "\r\n<P>The <B>otter <I>Lutra lutra</B></I> was once widespread in Europe, but populations declined sharply during the 1960s and 1970s due to pollution, exacerbated by hunting and habitat loss. Currently it has a rather discontinuous distribution with strong populations in Greece, Spain, Portugal and much of eastern Europe. Over most of continental western Europe the species is scarce to extinct, but reintroduction or restocking projects are in progress in several countries. </P>",
      "UKStatus": "\r\n<P>Historically, <B>otters <I>Lutra lutra</B></I> occurred over most of the UK. However, persecution, habitat loss and, more recently, the impact of toxic organochlorine insecticides caused a marked reduction in the range of the species. At present, the majority of the otter population in Great Britain occurs in Scotland, with a significant proportion of this number being found in the north and west of the country. Other strong populations survive in Wales and Ireland. The otter is still scarce over much of England, where the highest concentrations are in the south-west. However, recent surveys suggest that the otter population is recovering well and recolonising parts of its former range.</P>",
      "Rationale": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>The SAC series reflects the present discontinuous distribution of <B>otters <I>Lutra lutra</B></I> in the UK. Sites that are known to support high densities have been selected to represent the current strongholds of the population. The sites selected also cover the ecologically variable conditions in which the species is found across its range. As well as a known high density of otters, sites selected have good quality habitat features necessary for feeding and breeding. This is demonstrated by a known record of continuous occupation of the site, even, in England, during the period of population decline. Recent research has demonstrated that this approach has also ensured good coverage of the main lines of genetic variation in British otters.</P>\r\n<P>The otter population is widespread and individuals are wide-ranging, normally occurring at low densities, which is reflected in the relatively large number of sites where the species occurs as a qualifying feature, but is not a primary reason for site selection. The selected sites include some very extensive areas (totalling over 175,000 ha). While the SAC series makes a contribution to securing favourable conservation status for this Annex II species, wider countryside measures, in particular </FONT><A href=\"http://www.ukbap.org.uk/asp/UKPlans.asp?UKListID=428\">Biodiversity Action Plan</A><FONT size=2> implementation, additionally contribute to conservation of this species in the UK.</P></FONT>",

      "UKStatus": "\r\n<P>The <B>Harbour seal<I> Phoca vitulina</B></I> is widespread around the shores of the UK, but population density varies greatly from place to place, with low numbers at many sites. Harbour seal are found from Northern Ireland and the southern Firth of Clyde clockwise round the coast to the Thames estuary. The vast majority of common seal haul-outs are found on the coasts of Scotland, but with an additional important concentration on The Wash, and a smaller number in Strangford Lough, Northern Ireland. </P>\r\n<P>The UK holds at least 33,400 common seals. This is a minimum figure, counted at coastal haul-outs during the moulting period in August. The relationship between this number and total population size has not yet been fully established. Studies in Scotland and the Netherlands suggest that this number represents 60-70% of animals aged one year or older. Applying this correction factor indicates that the total population lies between 48,000 and 56,000.</P>",
      "Rationale": "<FONT size=2>\r\n<P>Site selection has favoured sites that are important both as general haul-out sites and for moulting and pupping. The largest breeding colony has been selected, in the south of the species’ range in the UK. The geographic range of breeding has been covered by the selection of a representative sample of relatively large colonies in the north. Sites have been selected using the most up-to-date population data available, but populations at individual sites may fluctuate, with low numbers at many sites, meaning it can be difficult to define the boundaries of specific sites. </P>\r\n<P>Haul-out areas are thought to be very important for the conservation of the species, as are the most important breeding colonies. As well as their importance in maintaining overall population size, larger breeding sites are significant as sources of emigration to smaller or newly-established colonies. </P>\r\n<P>While the SAC series makes a contribution to securing favourable conservation status for this Annex II species, wider measures are also necessary to support its conservation in the UK.</P></FONT>",

Areas of woodland with apparently suitable habitat were found to be very patchy, but a number of areas with good potential habitat were identified. It is thought possible that further survey may result in more new records for the species. Although sporophyte production is small, it is broadly comparable with that at the site at Moniack Gorge, Highland, and greater than that at Kindrogan, Perthshire.

In Great Britain it grows on constantly shaded and permanently humid rock faces, often in deep recesses, in wooded ravines and on cliffs, although in Ireland a wider range of habitats is occupied, and it has colonised numerous old wells in Brittany. The species is frost-sensitive, so that nearly all British localities for sporophyte plants are in mild oceanic districts in the far west and at low altitudes. Most sporophyte populations are very small. However, the gametophyte generation has been recorded from numerous localities (Rumsey <I>et al</I>. 1998), persisting in a state of indefinitely suspended development under present conditions; their occurrence does not alter views on the conservation needs of the sporophytes. The scattered colonies of the mature sporophyte may represent fragmented relics of a wider distribution during warmer post-glacial conditions now surviving under a sub-optimal climate. </P>\r\n<P>The main threat to <B><I>T. speciosum</B></I> in the British Isles has been from collecting, but it is also vulnerable to any changes to the flow or chemical composition of the water or to its habitat and microclimate. </P>",
